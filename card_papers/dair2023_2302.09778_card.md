# Composer: Creative and Controllable Image Synthesis with Composable Conditions

# Research questions
Q1: Can generative image models be made more controllable and customizable for practical applications?

Contribution: This work presents Composer, a new generation paradigm that allows flexible control of output images through compositional decomposition and recombination, thereby expanding the control space and enabling high-quality results for various image generation and manipulation tasks.

Note: The main research question is not explicitly stated in the passage, but it can be inferred as "How can we make generative image models more controllable and customizable?"

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

    * Introduction of DeepSeek-Coder-Base and DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct, advanced code-focused LLMs.
    * Development of repository-level data construction during pre-training for cross-file code generation capabilities.
    * Extensive evaluations demonstrating the superiority of the code LLMs over existing open-source models.

#### Keywords: Compositional Generative Models, Diffusion Models, Multitask Learning, Image Synthesis, Computer Vision, Compositionality
