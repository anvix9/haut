# Stable Video Diffusion: Scaling Latent Video Diffusion Models to Large Datasets

# Research questions
Q1: What are the three distinct stages for successful training of video LDMs proposed by the authors, and what is their significance in achieving good performance?

Contribution: We identify and evaluate three different stages for successful training of video LDMs: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining on a large dataset at low resolution, and high-resolution video finetuning on a much smaller dataset with higher-quality videos.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
 
    â€¢ Introducing three-stage training methodology, powerful motion representation, multi-view 3D-prior capabilities, and efficient approach for high-res text-to-video and image-to-video synthesis.

#### Keywords: Latent Diffusion Models, Generative Video Modeling, Text-to-Video Synthesis, Video Pretraining, Data Curation
