# AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation

# Research questions
Q1: How to design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in multi-agent collaboration? 
Contribution: This passage discusses AutoGen, a generalized multi-agent conversation framework that enables the creation of customizable and conversable agents that can leverage LLMs, human inputs, tools, or a combination of them.

Q2: How to develop a straightforward, unified interface that can accommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns? 
Contribution: This passage discusses AutoGen's conversation programming paradigm, which streamlines the development of intricate applications via two primary steps: defining conversable agents with specific capabilities and roles, and programming interaction behavior between agents via conversation-centric computation and control.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

• Introducing specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for coding, including the DeepSeek-Coder series.
• Developing repository-level data construction during pre-training for cross-file code generation capabilities.
