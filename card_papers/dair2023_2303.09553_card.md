# LERF: Language Embedded Radiance Fields

# Research questions
Q1: What problem does Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERF) aim to solve by grounding language within 3D scenes using off-the-shelf vision-language models like CLIP?

Contribution: LERF enables real-time, pixel-aligned, zero-shot queries on 3D scenes without relying on region proposals or masks, supporting long-tail open-vocabulary queries hierarchically across the volume.

In this passage, researchers aim to address the challenge of integrating natural language interfaces into 3D scenes, which requires not only handling natural language input queries but also incorporating semantics at multiple scales and relating to long-tail and abstract concepts. By grounding language within NeRF using CLIP embeddings, LERF solves this problem by providing a method for fusing raw CLIP embeddings into a NeRF in a dense, multi-scale fashion without requiring region proposals or fine-tuning. This enables the generation of 3D relevancy maps for a wide range of language prompts in real-time, supporting potential use cases in robotics, analyzing vision-language models, and interacting with 3D scenes.
