# UPRISE: Universal Prompt Retrieval for Improving Zero-Shot Evaluation

# Research questions
Q1: What is the proposed approach to improve zero-shot performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cross-task and cross-model scenarios, addressing the limitations of existing fine-tuning and prompt engineering methods?

Contribution: UPRISE ( U niversal P rompt R etrieval for I mproving ZeroS hot E valuation), a lightweight and versatile approach that tunes a prompt retriever to automatically retrieve prompts from a pre-constructed pool given a zero-shot task input, enabling cross-task generalization and adaptation to different LLMs of varying scales.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
**
• Introducing Universal Prompt Retrieval for Improving Zero-shot Evaluation (UPRISE) approach.
• Developing lightweight and versatile prompt retrieval method leveraging large language models as retrievers.
• Demonstrating universality across crosstask and cross-model scenarios with minimal frozen LLM size.

#### Keywords: Natural Language Processing, Prompt Engineering, Zero-Shot Learning, Cross-Task Adapting, Universal Prompt Retrieval
