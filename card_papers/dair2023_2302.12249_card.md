# MERF: Memory-Efficient Radiance Fields for Real-time View Synthesis in Unbounded Scenes

# Research questions
Q1: How can a real-time volumetric rendering system be developed that balances the trade-offs between volume vs. surface representations and memory bound vs. compute bound in order to achieve high-quality, accurate, and efficient rendering of large-scale scenes? 

Contribution: The proposed MERF (Memory-Efficient Radiance Field) approach addresses this challenge by introducing a novel hybrid volumetric parameterization that enables faster and more accurate real-time rendering of large and complicated real-world scenes than prior real-time NeRF-like models.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

  + Introduced MERF, a hybrid volumetric parameterization for efficient real-time rendering
  + Demonstrated improved quality and accuracy of radiance field-based rendering

#### Keywords: Neural Radiance Fields, Discretized Volumetric Representations, Radiance Fields, Volumetric Data Compression, Real-Time Rendering, Gradient-Based Optimization
