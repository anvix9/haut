# GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models

# Research questions
Q1: To what extent do large language models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) have general-purpose technological capabilities that could lead to significant economic, social, and policy implications?

Contribution: We investigate the potential implications of LLMs on the U.S. labor market, focusing on their increased capabilities compared to standalone LLM models. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
 Large Language Models, General-Purpose Technologies, Economic Implications, Social Implications, Policy Implications.

#### Keywords: Natural Language Processing, General Purpose Technologies, Automation Exposure, Technological Progression, AI Impact, Workforce Adaptation
