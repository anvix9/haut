# Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models

# Research questions
Q1: Can we develop a multimodal model with strong generalist capabilities across modalities, cutting-edge understanding and reasoning performance in each respective domain, and adapt it to various computational limitations and application requirements for different tasks? 

Contribution: We present Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models developed at Google, which is pre-trained jointly across image, audio, video, and text data and post-trained to improve overall quality and enhance target capabilities.
