# Visual ChatGPT: Talking, Drawing and Editing with Visual Foundation Models

# Research questions
Q1: Can a large language model like ChatGPT be extended to process and generate images from the visual world by incorporating multiple visual foundation models and designing a prompt manager to facilitate their collaboration? 

Contribution: The authors propose Visual ChatGPT, a system that enables users to interact with ChatGPT beyond language format by combining it with different visual foundation models. They design a Prompt Manager to inject visual information into ChatGPT and handle the complexities of multiple models and tasks, allowing for iterative feedback and collaboration between ChatGPT and Visual Foundation Models.
