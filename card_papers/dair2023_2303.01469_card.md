# Consistency Models

# Research questions
Q1: Can consistency models improve the efficiency of diffusion models in one-step generation while maintaining their quality, by reducing computational costs without sacrificing sample quality or enabling zero-shot data editing capabilities?

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
**
	+ Introducing a new family of generative models that support fast and high-quality sampling for one-step generation.
	+ Enabling zero-shot data editing tasks such as image inpainting, colorization, and super-resolution.

#### Keywords: Consistency Models, Score-Based Generative Models, Diffusion Models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Natural Language Processing, Probabilistic Flow Models
