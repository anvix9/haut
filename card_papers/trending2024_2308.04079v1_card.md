# 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering

# Research questions
Q1: Can a hybrid approach combining continuous Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) methods with discrete 3D Gaussian representations achieve fast GPU-based rendering for scenes captured with multiple photos, while maintaining state-of-the-art visual quality?

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

  • Advancements in open-source code modeling with DeepSeek-Coder-Base and DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct.
  • Repository-level data construction during pre-training for cross-file code generation capabilities.
  • Extensive evaluations of the code LLMs against various benchmarks.

#### Keywords: 3D Gaussian Representation, Radiance Field Methods, Real-Time Rendering, Volumetric Ray-Marching, Optimization Techniques for Implicit Representations
