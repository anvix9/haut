# The Falcon Series of Open Language Models

# Research questions
Q1: How do increasingly large-scale language models achieve emergent capabilities that can be tailored to human preference?

Answer: Increasingly large-scale language models, such as the Falcon series, give rise to so-called emergent capabilities that can be further tailored to human preference, enabling the construction of instruction-following or chatty models.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

* Introducing advanced code-focused large language models (DeepSeek-Coder series)
* Developing repository-level data construction during pre-training
* Conducting extensive evaluations of code LLMs against various benchmarks
