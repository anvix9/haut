# Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis

# Research questions
Q1: Can a novel rectified flow formulation for text-to-image synthesis outperform existing diffusion formulations when using a large-scale study?

Contribution: Through a large-scale study, the authors demonstrate the superior performance of their new noise sampling technique compared to established diffusion formulations, particularly in high-resolution text-to-image synthesis.
