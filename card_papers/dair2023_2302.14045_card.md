# Language Is Not All You Need: Aligning Perception with Language Models

# Research questions
Q1: Can large language models (LLMs) perceive general modalities, learn in context (i.e., few-shot), and follow instructions (i.e., zero-shot), and what are the key applications of these capabilities?

Contribution: The authors introduce KOSMOS-1, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that can effectively perceive multimodal input, perform few-shot learning, and follow instructions in zero-shot settings. This work demonstrates the capabilities of MLLMs on various tasks, including language understanding, perception-language tasks, vision tasks, and nonverbal reasoning tasks.

Research Question: Q2: How do large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) address the limitations in natively using LLMs for multimodal data, such as image, and audio?

Contribution: The authors show that KOSMOS-1 can bridge this gap by developing a model that can perceive general modalities, learn in context, and follow instructions. This enables MLLMs to be used in high-value areas like multimodal machine learning, document intelligence, and robotics.

Research Question: Q3: What is the potential of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in advancing artificial general intelligence by aligning perception with LLMs?

Contribution: The authors demonstrate that KOSMOS-1 can acquire commonsense knowledge beyond text descriptions, enabling new opportunities for applications like robotics and document intelligence. By aligning perception with LLMs, MLLMs can unify various APIs, providing a unified way to interact with graphical user interfaces.

Research Question: Q4: How do multimodal large language models (MLLMs) address the limitations in handling multi-turn interactions for general modalities, such as multimodal dialogue?

Contribution: The authors show that KOSMOS-1 naturally supports multi-turn interactions for general modalities, enabling new capabilities like multimodal dialogue.
