# Language-Driven Representation Learning for Robotics

# Research questions
Q1: Can languagedriven visual representation learning frameworks outperform existing representations across a diverse spectrum of problems in robot learning?

Contribution: We present V oltron, a framework for languagedriven visual representation learning that learns representations capturing both low-level and high-level features, outperforming prior approaches across all applications.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

• Introducing advanced code-focused Large Language Models (LLMs) such as DeepSeek-Coder-Base and DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct.
• Repository-level data construction for cross-file code generation capabilities.
• Extensive evaluations of the code LLMs against various benchmarks.

#### Keywords: Visual Representation Learning, Languagedriven Visual Learning, Contrastive Learning, Masked Autoencoding, Robot Learning
