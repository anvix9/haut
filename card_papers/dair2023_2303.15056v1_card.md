# ChatGPT Outperforms Crowd-Workers for Text-Annotation Tasks

# Research questions
Q1: Can large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT be used to replace crowd-workers on platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) for text annotation tasks?

Contribution: Our analysis demonstrates that ChatGPT's zero-shot accuracy exceeds that of MTurk, its intercoder agreement is superior to both MTurk and trained annotators, and it is significantly cheaper than MTurk.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

  • Zero-shot accuracy of ChatGPT exceeding that of crowd-workers for most tasks
  • Superior intercoder agreement among ChatGPT, compared to both crowd-workers and trained annotators
  • Significant cost-effectiveness (per-annotation cost) of ChatGPT, reducing costs by up to twenty times

#### Keywords: Natural Language Processing, Text Classification, Crowdsourcing, Annotation Tasks, Large Language Models
