# A Comprehensive Capability Analysis of GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 Series Models

# Research questions
Q1: Does the evolution of GPT series models lead to universal improvements across all natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, or are there specific limitations and characteristics that influence their performance?

Contribution: The study evaluates the performance and robustness of six representative GPT series models across nine NLU tasks using 21 datasets. 

Key Research Problem:
Although GPT series models have gained significant attention due to their exceptional natural language processing capabilities, their evolution does not necessarily lead to universal improvements across all NLU tasks. The study reveals that different training strategies and task characteristics can significantly impact the performance and robustness of these models, indicating a need for further investigation into how to balance task-solving ability with user-friendly response capabilities and improve model robustness while enhancing its performance.

The researchers conducted an extensive analysis of six GPT series models, including GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, across nine NLU tasks. Their findings suggest that the evolution of GPT series models does not guarantee improvements in all areas, such as task-specific strengths and weaknesses, model robustness, and alignment with human cognition.

The study raises important questions about the limitations of current GPT series models and highlights the need for further research into developing more robust and adaptable NLU models.
