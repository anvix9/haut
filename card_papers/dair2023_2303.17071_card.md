# DERA: Enhancing Large Language Model Completions with Dialog-Enabled Resolving Agents

# Research questions
Q1: Can large language models (LLMs) be effectively used to generate factually accurate outputs for safety-critical tasks in healthcare without relying on manual supervision or expensive human judgment, and if so, what are the limitations and challenges of existing prompting architectures?

Contribution: The researchers present a framework called DERA (Dialog-Enabled Resolving Agents), which enables large language models to generate factually accurate outputs for clinical tasks such as medical conversation summarization, care plan generation, and question answering through an iterative dialog-based approach.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
**
* Introducing DERA, a dialog-enabled resolving agent framework that enables LLMs to generate factually accurate outputs for clinical tasks through an iterative dialog-based approach.
* Developing repository-level data construction during pre-training to boost cross-file code generation capabilities.
* Conducting extensive evaluations of the code LLMs against various benchmarks.

#### Keywords: Natural Language Processing, Conversational AI, Dialog-enabled Resolving Agents, Medical Question Answering, Clinical Task Generation
