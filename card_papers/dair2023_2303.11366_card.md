# Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning

# Research questions
Q1: Can large language models (LLMs) effectively learn from trial-and-error by reflecting on past mistakes without extensive training samples and expensive model fine-tuning?

Contribution: Reflexion, a novel framework that leverages verbal reinforcement to teach LLM agents to learn from past mistakes, achieves significant improvements over baseline agents across diverse tasks, including decision-making, coding, and language reasoning.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
 Introduced Reflexion, a novel framework leveraging verbal reinforcement to teach LLM agents to learn from past mistakes, and advanced the field by proposing a novel optimization technique.

#### Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing, Linguistic Feedback, Self-Reflection, Episodic Memory
