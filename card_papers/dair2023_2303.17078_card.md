# Machine Learning for Partial Differential Equations

# Research questions
Q1: What new avenues of research in partial differential equations (PDEs) are being advanced by machine learning?

Contribution: The advent of machine learning is providing an entirely new approach for solving PDEs based on the increasing wealth of high-quality data generated from both simulations and experiments, enabling techniques such as proxy, reduced-order models, symbolic regression, and operator learning.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

- Introducing specialized LLMs for coding
- Developing repository-level data construction during pre-training
- Conducting extensive evaluations against various benchmarks

#### Keywords: Partial Differential Equations, Machine Learning for PDEs, Reduced-Order Models, Koopman Operator Theory, Operator Learning, Computational Approximations
