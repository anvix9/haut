# OpenICL: An Open-Source Framework for In-context Learning

# Research questions
Q1: What unified framework is needed to streamline In-Context Learning (ICL) and make its implementation more accessible?

Contribution: The authors propose an open-source toolkit called OpenICL, which provides a unified and flexible architecture for ICL, facilitating systematic evaluations and comparisons of various methods.
