# Research questions
Q1: Can Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) surpass human creativity in various tasks?

Contribution: A study testing human-generated ideas against those generated by six GAI chatbots showed no qualitative difference in creativity between humans and GAI, but highlighted the potential value of GAIs as assistants in the creative process.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

• Introduced GAI chatbots for generating ideas, showcasing their creativity and value as assistants
• Demonstrated no qualitative difference in creativity between humans and GAI
• Highlighted the limitations of GAI's capabilities and importance of human creative roles.
