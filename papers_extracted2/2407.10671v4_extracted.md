## ABSTRACT

This report introduces the Qwen2 series, the latest addition to our large language models and large multimodal models. We release a comprehensive suite of foundational and instruction-tuned language models, encompassing a parameter range from 0.5 to 72 billion, featuring dense models and a Mixture-of-Experts model. Qwen2 surpasses most prior open-weight models, including its predecessor Qwen1.5, and exhibits competitive performance relative to proprietary models across diverse benchmarks on language understanding, generation, multilingual proficiency, coding, mathematics, and reasoning.

The flagship model, Qwen2-72B, showcases remarkable performance: 84.2 on MMLU,37.9 on GPQA, 64.6 on HumanEval, 89.5 on GSM8K, and 82.4 on BBH as a base language model. The instruction-tuned variant, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, attains 9.1 on MT-Bench, 48.1 on Arena-Hard, and 35.7 on LiveCodeBench. Moreover, Qwen2 demonstrates robust multilingual capabilities, proficient in approximately 30 languages, spanning English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Arabic, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, and more, underscoring its versatility and global reach.

To foster community innovation and accessibility, we have made the Qwen2 model weights openly available on Hugging Face 1 and ModelScope 2 , and the supplementary materials including example code on GitHub 3 . These platforms also include resources for quantization, fine-tuning, and deployment, facilitating a wide range of applications and research endeavors.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Following the emergence of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022), enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs) has escalated globally. The release of the Llama series (Touvron et al., 2023) has further ignited interests within the open-source community, particularly regarding GPT-level local LLMs. Recently, Claude-3 Opus (Anthropic, 2024) and GPT-4o (omni) (OpenAI, 2024), the updated model for ChatGPT, have ascended to the pinnacle of the Chatbot Arena (Chiang et al., 2024) in quick succession. This platform is well-regarded for its human evaluations of LLMs. Moreover, Llama3 (AI@Meta, 2024) has emerged as the state-of-the-art open-weight model series, narrowing the performance gap with leading proprietary models and widely acknowledged as GPT-4-level. An increasing number of competitive LLMs are now pursuing advancements similar to those made by the GPT series from OpenAI. Many of these models, including Qwen (Bai et al., 2023a), Mistral (Jiang et al., 2023a), Gemma (Mesnard et al., 2024), etc., have been released in an open-weight manner.

Over recent months, we have successively introduced the Qwen series (Bai et al., 2023a) and progressed to Qwen1.5 (Qwen Team, 2024a). In the meantime, we have unveiled the vision-language model Qwen-VL (Bai et al., 2023b), and launched the audio-language model Qwen-Audio (Chu et al., 2023). In this work, we introduce the newest addition to the Qwen family of large language models and large multimodal modles: Qwen2 . Qwen2 is a series of LLMs, grounded in the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), trained using next-token prediction. The model series encompasses foundational, i.e., base language models, pre-trained but unaligned to human preferences, and instruction-tuned models, fine-tuned with single-turn and multi-turn instructionfollowing datasets suitable for chat and agent purposes. Our release comprises four dense models with parameter counts of 0.5 billion, 1.5 billion, 7 billion, and 72 billion, plus a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 57 billion parameters, of which 14 billion are activated for each token. The smaller models, specifically Qwen2-0.5B and Qwen2-1.5B, are designed for easy deployment on portable devices such as smartphones, earphones, and smart glasses. Conversely, the larger models cater to deployment across GPUs of varying scales.

All models were pre-trained on a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 7 trillion tokens, covering a wide range of domains and languages. Compared to previous editions of Qwen, Qwen2 includes a broader spectrum of linguistic data, enhancing the quantity and quality of code and mathematics content. This enrichment is hypothesized to improve reasoning abilities of LLMs. Regarding post-training, all models underwent supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization (DPO, Rafailov et al., 2023), aligning them with human preferences through learning from human feedback. This process endows the models with the capability to follow instructions effectively.

We have conducted a thorough evaluation of Qwen2, alongside a selection of baseline models including both open-weight and proprietary models accessible via API. Qwen2 outperforms competing models in evaluations of both fundamental language capabilities and instruction-tuned functionalities Specifically, Qwen2-72B-Instruct, our instruction-tuned variant, scores 9.1 on MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023), 48.1 on Arena-Hard (Chiang et al., 2024), and 35.7 on LiveCodeBench (Jain et al., 2024). Meanwhile, Qwen2-72B, the base language model, achieves 84.2 on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021a), 37.9 on GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), 64.6 on HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), 89.5 on GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and 82.4 on BBH (Suzgun et al., 2023).

## 2.2 MODEL ARCHITECTURE

The Qwen2 series fundamentally constitute large language models based on the Transformer architecture, featuring self-attention with causal masks (Vaswani et al., 2017). Specifically, this series encompasses dense language models of 4 scales and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model. We introduce the specifics of the dense models before delving into the MoE model's distinctive attributes.

## 6 CONCLUSION

This technical report has presented the Qwen2 series, a versatile suite of foundational and instructiontuned language models, ranging from 0.5 to 72 billion parameters, including models of dense and Mixture-of-Experts architecture. Qwen2 outperforms previous open-weight models, notably its predecessor Qwen1.5, and displays competitive performance against proprietary models across a broad spectrum of benchmarks in language understanding, generation, multilingual capabilities, coding, mathematics, and reasoning. In this update, we have extra focus on long-context, multilingual, coding, mathematics capabilities and safety and responsibility. In a commitment to fostering innovation and accessibility within the community, we have made the Qwen2 model weights openly accessible, which enables researchers and developers to harness the full potential of Qwen2 in a variety of applications and research projects. Through these efforts, we aim to contribute to the advancement of AI technologies and their positive impact on society.
