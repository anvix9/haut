## ABSTRACT

Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, enabling natural language processing tasks that were previously thought to be exclusive to humans. In this work, we introduce QWEN 1 , the first installment of our large language model series. QWEN is a comprehensive language model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter counts. It includes QWEN, the base pretrained language models, and QWEN-CHAT, the chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques. The base language models consistently demonstrate superior performance across a multitude of downstream tasks, and the chat models, particularly those trained using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are highly competitive. The chat models possess advanced tool-use and planning capabilities for creating agent applications, showcasing impressive performance even when compared to bigger models on complex tasks like utilizing a code interpreter. Furthermore, we have developed coding-specialized models, CODE-QWEN and CODE-QWEN-CHAT, as well as mathematics-focused models, MATH-QWEN-CHAT, which are built upon base language models. These models demonstrate significantly improved performance in comparison with open-source models, and slightly fall behind the proprietary models.

## 1 INTRODUCTION

Large language models (LLMs) (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a;b) have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence (AI) by providing a powerful foundation for complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks. These models have the ability to compress vast knowledge into neural networks, making them incredibly versatile agents. With a chat interface, LLMs can perform tasks that were previously thought to be the exclusive domain of humans, especially those involving creativity and expertise (OpenAI, 2022; Ouyang et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023; Google, 2023; Anthropic, 2023a;b). They can engage in natural language conversations with humans, answering questions, providing information, and even generating creative content such as stories, poems, and music. This has led to the development of a wide range of applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to language translation and summarization tools.

LLMs are not just limited to language tasks. They can also function as a generalist agent (Reed et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2023a; AutoGPT, 2023; Hong et al., 2023), collaborating with external systems, tools, and models to achieve the objectives set by humans. For example, LLMs can understand multimodal instructions (OpenAI, 2023; Bai et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a; Ye et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023b), execute code (Chen et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023d), use tools (Schick et al., 2023; LangChain, Inc., 2023; AutoGPT, 2023), and more. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for AI applications, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to healthcare and finance. As these models continue to evolve and improve, we can expect to see even more innovative and exciting applications in the years to come. Whether it's helping us solve complex problems, creating new forms of entertainment, or transforming the way we live and work, LLMs are poised to play a central role in shaping the future of AI.

Figure 1: Model Lineage of the Qwen Series. We have pretrained the language models, namely QWEN, on massive datasets containing trillions of tokens. We then use SFT and RLHF to align QWEN to human preference and thus we have QWEN-CHAT and specifically its improved version QWEN-CHAT-RLHF. Additionally, we also develop specialized models for coding and mathematics, such as CODE-QWEN, CODE-QWEN-CHAT, and MATH-QWEN-CHAT based on QWEN with similar techniques. Note that we previously released the multimodal LLM, QWEN-VL and QWEN-VLCHAT (Bai et al., 2023), which are also based on our QWEN base models.

Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs are often criticized for their lack of reproducibility, steerability, and accessibility to service providers. In this work, we are pleased to present and release the initial version of our LLM series, QWEN. QWEN is a moniker that derives from the Chinese phrase Qianwen, which translates to 'thousands of prompts' and conveys the notion of embracing a wide range of inquiries. QWEN is a comprehensive language model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter counts. The model series include the base pretrained language models, chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques, i.e., supervised finetuning (SFT), reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), etc., as well as specialized models in coding and math. The details are outlined below:

- 1. The base language models, namely QWEN, have undergone extensive training using up to 3 trillion tokens of diverse texts and codes, encompassing a wide range of areas. These models have consistently demonstrated superior performance across a multitude of downstream tasks, even when compared to their more significantly larger counterparts.
- 2. The QWEN-CHAT models have been carefully finetuned on a curated dataset relevant to task performing, chat, tool use, agent, safety, etc. The benchmark evaluation demonstrates that the SFT models can achieve superior performance. Furthermore, we have trained reward models to mimic human preference and applied them in RLHF for chat models that can produce responses preferred by humans. Through the human evaluation of a challenging test, we find that QWEN-CHAT models trained with RLHF are highly competitive, still falling behind GPT-4 on our benchmark.
- 3. In addition, we present specialized models called CODE-QWEN, which includes CODEQWEN-7B and CODE-QWEN-14B, as well as their chat models, CODE-QWEN-14BCHAT and CODE-QWEN-7B-CHAT. Specifically, CODE-QWEN has been pre-trained on extensive datasets of code and further fine-tuned to handle conversations related to code generation, debugging, and interpretation. The results of experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, such as HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021), MBPP (Austin et al., 2021), and HumanEvalPack (Muennighoff et al., 2023), demonstrate the high level of proficiency of CODE-QWEN in code understanding and generation.
- 4. This research additionally introduces MATH-QWEN-CHAT specifically designed to tackle mathematical problems. Our results show that both MATH-QWEN-7B-CHAT and MATHQWEN-14B-CHAT outperform open-sourced models in the same sizes with large margins and are approaching GPT-3.5 on math-related benchmark datasets such as GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) and MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021).
- 5. Besides, we have open-sourced QWEN-VL and QWEN-VL-CHAT, which have the versatile ability to comprehend visual and language instructions. These models outperform the current open-source vision-language models across various evaluation benchmarks and support text recognition and visual grounding in both Chinese and English languages. Moreover, these models enable multi-image conversations and storytelling. Further details can be found in Bai et al. (2023).

Now, we officially open-source the 14B-parameter and 7B-parameter base pretrained models QWEN and aligned chat models QWEN-CHAT 2 . This release aims at providing more comprehensive and powerful LLMs at developer- or application-friendly scales.

The structure of this report is as follows: Section 2 describes our approach to pretraining and results of QWEN. Section 3 covers our methodology for alignment and reports the results of both automatic evaluation and human evaluation. Additionally, this section describes details about our efforts in building chat models capable of tool use, code interpreter, and agent. In Sections 4 and 5, we delve into specialized models of coding and math and their performance. Section 6 provides an overview of relevant related work, and Section 7 concludes this paper and points out our future work.

## 2.3 ARCHITECTURE

QWEN is designed using a modified version of the Transformer architecture. Specifically, we have adopted the recent open-source approach of training large language models, LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), which is widely regarded as the top open-source LLM. Our modifications to the architecture include:

Table 1: Model sizes, architectures, and optimization hyper-parameters.

| # of Params   |   Hidden size |   Heads |   Layers | Learning rate   | Batch size   | Training tokens   |
|---------------|---------------|---------|----------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1.8B          |          2048 |      16 |       24 | 3 . 0 × 10 - 4  | 4M           | 2.2T              |
| 7B            |          4096 |      32 |       32 | 3 . 0 × 10 - 4  | 4M           | 2.4T              |
| 14B           |          5120 |      40 |       40 | 3 . 0 × 10 - 4  | 4M           | 3.0T              |

- · Embedding and output projection . Based on preliminary experimental findings, we have opted for the untied embedding approach instead of tying the weights of input embedding and output projection. This decision was made in order to achieve better performance with the price of memory costs.
- · Positional embedding . We have chosen RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) (Su et al., 2021) as our preferred option for incorporating positional information into our model. RoPE has been widely adopted and has demonstrated success in contemporary large language models, notably PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022; Anil et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b). In particular, we have opted to use FP32 precision for the inverse frequency matrix, rather than BF16 or FP16, in order to prioritize model performance and achieve higher accuracy.
- · Bias . For most layers, we remove biases following Chowdhery et al. (2022), but we add biases in the QKV layer of attention to enhance the extrapolation ability of the model (Su, 2023b).
- · Pre-Norm & RMSNorm . In modern Transformer models, pre-normalization is the most widely used approach, which has been shown to improve training stability compared to post-normalization. Recent research has suggested alternative methods for better training stability, which we plan to explore in future versions of our model. Additionally, we have replaced the traditional layer normalization technique described in (Ba et al., 2016) with RMSNorm (Jiang et al., 2023). This change has resulted in equivalent performance while also improving efficiency.
- · Activation function . We have selected SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020) as our activation function, a combination of Swish (Ramachandran et al., 2017) and Gated Linear Unit (Dauphin et al., 2017). Our initial experiments have shown that activation functions based on GLU generally outperform other baseline options, such as GeLU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016). As is common practice in previous research, we have reduced the dimension of the feed-forward network (FFN) from 4 times the hidden size to 8 3 of the hidden size.

## 3.2.1 REWARD MODEL

To create a successful reward model, like building a large language model (LLM), it is crucial to first undergo pretraining and then finetuning. This pretraining process, also known as preference model pretraining (PMP) (Bai et al., 2022b), necessitates a vast dataset of comparison data. This dataset consists of sample pairs, each containing two distinct responses for a single query and their corresponding preferences. Similarly, finetuning is also conducted on this type of comparison data, but with a higher quality due to the presence of quality annotations.

During the fine-tuning phase, we gather a variety of prompts and adjust the reward model based on human feedback for responses from the QWEN models. To ensure the diversity and complexity of user prompts are properly taken into account, we have created a classification system with around 6600 detailed tags and implemented a balanced sampling algorithm that considers both diversity and complexity when selecting prompts for annotation by the reward model (Lu et al., 2023). To generate a wide range of responses, we have utilized QWEN models of different sizes and sampling strategies, as diverse responses can help reduce annotation difficulties and enhance the performance of the reward model. These responses are then evaluated by annotators following a standard annotation guideline, and comparison pairs are formed based on their scores.

In creating the reward model, we utilize the same-sized pre-trained language model QWEN to initiate the process. It is important to mention that we have incorporated a pooling layer into the original

|-----------|---------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| PMP       |               62.68 |                 61.62 |                    76.52 |                      65.43 |          69.6  |          60.05 |            70.59 |
| RM        |               74.78 |                 69.71 |                    73.98 |                      64.57 |          69.99 |          60.1  |            70.52 |

QWEN model to extract the reward for a sentence based on a specific end token. The learning rate for this process has been set to a constant value of 3 × 10 -6 , and the batch size is 64 . Additionally, the sequence length is set to 2048 , and the training process lasts for a single epoch.

We adopted the accuracy on the test dataset as an important but not exclusive evaluation metric for the reward model. In Table 4, we report the test pairwise accuracy of PMP and reward models on diverse human preference benchmark datasets (Bai et al., 2022b; Stiennon et al., 2020; Ethayarajh et al., 2022; Lightman et al., 2023). Specifically, QWEN Helpful-base and QWEN Helpful-online are our proprietary datasets. The responses in QWEN Helpful-base are generated from QWEN without RLHF, whereas QWEN Helpful-online includes responses from QWEN with RLHF. The results show that the PMP model demonstrates high generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, and the reward model demonstrates significant improvement on our QWEN reward datasets.

## 7 CONCLUSION

In this report, we present the QWEN series of large language models, which showcase the latest advancements in natural language processing. With 14B, 7B, and 1.8B parameters, these models have been pre-trained on massive amounts of data, including trillions of tokens, and fine-tuned using cutting-edge techniques such as SFT and RLHF. Additionally, the QWEN series includes specialized models for coding and mathematics, such as CODE-QWEN, CODE-QWEN-CHAT, and MATH-QWENCHAT, which have been trained on domain-specific data to excel in their respective fields. Our results demonstrate that the QWEN series is competitive with existing open-source models and even matches the performance of some proprietary models on comprehensive benchmarks and human evaluation.

We believe that the open access of QWEN will foster collaboration and innovation within the community, enabling researchers and developers to build upon our work and push the boundaries of what is possible with language models. By providing these models to the public, we hope to inspire new research and applications that will further advance the field and contribute to our understanding of the variables and techniques introduced in realistic settings. In a nutshell, the QWEN series represents a major milestone in our development of large language models, and we are excited to see how it will be used to drive progress and innovation in the years to come.
