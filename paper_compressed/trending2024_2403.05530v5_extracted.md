## 1. Introduction

We present our latest multimodal models from the Gemini line: Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash. They are members of Gemini 1.5, a new family of highly-capable multimodal models which incorporates our latest innovations in sparse and dense scaling as well as major advances in training, distillation and serving infrastructure that allow it to push the boundary of efficiency, reasoning, planning, multi-linguality, function calling and long-context performance. Gemini 1.5 models are built to handle extremely long contexts; they have the ability to recall and reason over fine-grained information from up to at least 10M tokens. This scale is unprecedented among contemporary large language models (LLMs), and enables the processing of long-form mixed-modality inputs including entire collections of documents, multiple hours of video, and almost five days long of audio.

The Gemini 1.5 Pro presented in this report is an update over the previous Gemini 1.5 Pro February version and it outperforms it predecessor on most capabilities and benchmarks. All in all, the Gemini 1.5 series represents a generational leap in model performance and training efficiency. Gemini 1.5 Pro surpasses Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.0 Ultra on a wide array of benchmarks while requiring significantly less compute to train. Similarly, Gemini 1.5 Flash performs uniformly better compared to 1.0 Pro and even performs at a similar level to 1.0 Ultra on several benchmarks.

The ability to model data of increasingly longer contexts has tracked the development of more general and capable language models, from the now toy 2-gram language model proposed by Shannon

Figure 1 | Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves near-perfect 'needle' recall ( > 99.7%) up to 1M tokens of 'haystack' in all modalities, i.e., text, video and audio. It even maintains this recall performance when extending to 10M tokens in the text modality (approximately 7M words); 9.7M tokens in the audio modality (up to 107 hours); 9.9M tokens in the video modality (up to 10.5 hours). The x-axis represents the context window, and the y-axis the depth percentage of the needle placed for a given context length. The results are color-coded to indicate: green for successful retrievals and red for unsuccessful ones. Note that the performance for all modalities is obtained with the previously reported Gemini 1.5 Pro version from February.

(1948), to the modern n-gram models of the 1990s & 2000s typically constrained to 5 tokens of context (Brants et al., 2007; Chen and Goodman, 1999; Jelinek, 1998; Kneser and Ney, 1995), to recurrent neural networks language models from the 2010s which could effectively condition on hundreds of tokens (Jozefowicz et al., 2016; Mikolov et al., 2010), to the modern Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) which can condition on hundreds of thousands of tokens (Anthropic, 2023a). Gemini 1.5 Pro continues this trend by extending language model context lengths by over an order of magnitude. Scaling to millions of tokens, we find a continued improvement in predictive performance (Section 5.2.1.1), near perfect recall ( > 99%) on synthetic retrieval tasks (Figure 1 and Section 5.2.1.2), and a host of surprising new capabilities like in-context learning from entire long documents and multimodal content (Section 5.2.2).

To measure the effectiveness of our models' multimodal long-context capabilities, we conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world tasks. In synthetic 'needle-in-a-haystack' tasks inspired by Kamradt (2023) that probe how reliably the model can recall information amidst distractor context, we find that both Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash achieve near-perfect ( > 99%) 'needle' recall up to multiple millions of tokens of 'haystack' in all modalities, i.e., text, video and audio. As part of our experimental setup, we also assessed the performance of Gemini 1.5 Pro when extending

the context to 10M tokens across all three modalities. We found that the recall performance was maintained even with this significant increase in context size.

Table 1 | Gemini 1.5 Pro Win-rates compared to Gemini 1.5 Pro from the February release, as well as the Gemini 1.0 family. Gemini 1.5 Pro maintains high levels of performance even as its context window increases. Detailed results are presented in Table 10. ∗ In speech recognition, it is generally accepted that any difference in Word Error Rate (WER) that falls within a 3% relative range is not statistically significant and can be considered as mere noise, and we grouped such instances as wins for the latest systems.

In more realistic multimodal long-context benchmarks which require retrieval and reasoning over multiple parts of the context (such as answering questions from long documents or long videos), we also see Gemini 1.5 Pro outperforming all competing models across all modalities even when these models are augmented with external retrieval methods. We showcase the in-context learning abilities of both Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash enabled by very long context: for example, learning to translate a new language from a single set of linguistic documentation. With only instructional materials (a 500-page reference grammar, a dictionary, and ≈ 400 extra parallel sentences) all provided in context, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash are capable of learning to translate from

English to Kalamang- a Papuan language with fewer than 200 speakers 2 and therefore almost no online presence-with quality similar to a person who learned from the same materials. Moreover, we add in 45 minutes of transcribed Kalamang speech recordings to demonstrate that Gemini 1.5, for the first time with an LLM, can leverage mixed-modal documentation to learn speech recognition for a new language in context. We further showcase how long-context capability of Gemini 1.5 models break grounds on long-context automatic speech recognition, long-context video understanding, in-context planning and unstructured multimodal data analytics tasks.

Importantly, this leap in long-context performance does not come at the expense of the core multimodal capabilities of the model. 3 Across a extensive battery of evaluations, both Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash greatly surpass Gemini 1.0 Pro (44/50 for Gemini 1.5 Pro and 41/50 for Gemini 1.5 Flash). These include core capabilities such as Math, Science and Reasoning (+49.6% and +30.8%, respectively, Sec. 6.1.1), Multilinguality (+21.4% and +16.7%, Sec. 6.1.4), Video Understanding (+18.7% and +7.5%, Sec. 6.2.4), Natural Image Understanding (+21.7% and +18.9%, Sec. 6.2.3), Chart and Document Understanding (+63.9% and +35.9%, Sec. 6.2.2), Multimodal Reasoning (+31.5% and +15.6%, Sec. 6.2.1), Code (+21.5% and +10.3%, Sec. 6.1.3), and more (see Table 10 and Table 2 for full breakdowns). These evaluations additionally evaluate on a series of 'agentic' tasks including Function Calling (+72.8% and +54.6%, Sec. 6.1.5), planning (Sec. 5.2.2.7) and in-the-wild long-tail real world use cases such as improving job productivity for professionals (Sec. 6.1.7). These advances are particularly striking when benchmarking against Gemini 1.0 Ultra, a state-of-the-art model across many capabilities. Despite using significantly less training compute and being more efficient to serve, Gemini 1.5 Pro performs better on more than half of the overall benchmarks (35/45), and the majority of vision (18/21) and text (16/19) benchmarks. For Gemini 1.5 Flash, which substantially more efficient to serve and faster at inference time, we find it to be be better than Ultra 1.0 on the majority of vision benchmarks (13/21) and almost half the text benchmarks (8/18).

In the following sections, we provide an overview of the model architecture and present the results of large-scale quantitative evaluations comparing Gemini 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash to other LLMs. We present detailed evaluations for the models' long context capabilities followed by evaluations of their core capabilities, similar to the Gemini 1.0 Technical Report (Gemini-Team et al., 2023), covering well-studied benchmarks across text, code, image, video and audio. Finally, we discuss our approach to responsible deployment, including our process for impact assessment developing model policies, evaluations, and mitigations of harm before deployment decisions. 4

## 3. Model Architecture



## 4. Training Infrastructure and Dataset

Like Gemini 1.0 series, Gemini 1.5 models are trained on multiple 4096-chip pods of Google's TPUv4 accelerators, distributed across multiple datacenters, and on a variety of multimodal and multilingual data. Our pre-training dataset includes data sourced across many different domains, including web documents and code, and incorporates image, audio, and video content. For the instructiontuning phase we finetuned Gemini 1.5 models on a collection of multimodal data (containing paired instructions and appropriate responses), with further tuning based on human preference data. We refer readers to the Gemini 1.0 Technical Report (Gemini-Team et al., 2023) for further information.

## 5.2. Long-context Evaluations

For the past few years, LLM research has prioritized expanding the context window from which models can incorporate information (Anthropic, 2023a; OpenAI, 2023a). This emphasis stems from the recognition that a wider context window allows models to incorporate a larger amount of new, taskspecific information not found in the training data at inference time, leading to improved performance in various natural language or multimodal tasks. Recent approaches to improving the long-context capabilities of models fall into a few categories, including novel architectural approaches (Ainslie et al., 2023; Gu and Dao, 2023; Guo et al., 2021; Orvieto et al., 2023; Zaheer et al., 2020), posttraining modifications (Bertsch et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b; Press et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2023), retrieval-augmented models (Guu et al., 2020; Izacard et al., 2022; Jiang et al., 2022; Karpukhin et al., 2020; Santhanam et al., 2021), memory-augmented models (Bulatov et al., 2022, 2023; Martins et al., 2022; Mu et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022a,b; Zhong et al., 2022), and techniques for building more coherent long-context datasets (Shi et al., 2023b; Staniszewski et al., 2023). This activity has resulted in measurable improvements on long-context capabilities of LLMs over the past several months, with the recent concurrent work of Liu et al. (2024) exploring context window of 7B models up to 1M multimodal tokens. Notably, among the state-of-the-art LLMs, Anthropic has successfully extended the context of their text-only Claude 2 model to 100k tokens, while OpenAI has recently

Figure 7 | Cumulative average negative log-likelihood (NLL) as a function of token position in long documents and code data. A lower value demonstrates better prediction. Gemini 1.5 Pro shows improved predictions up to 1M tokens for long-documents and 10M tokens for code, whereas Gemini 1.0 Pro improves up to only 32K tokens. Gemini 1.5 Flash shows improvement up to 1M tokens for long-documents and 2M tokens in code. The NLL of Gemini 1.5 Pro follows a power-law trend up until 1M tokens (documents) and 2M tokens (code) with a deviating trend at 10M tokens.

released GPT-4 Turbo reaching 128k tokens. Finally, the latest addition to the series was Claude 3 with a context window of up to 1M tokens.

Gemini 1.5 Pro significantly extend this context length frontier to multiple millions of tokens with almost no degradation in performance, making it possible to process significantly larger inputs. Compared to Claude 2.1 with a 200k token context window, Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves a 100% recall at 200k tokens, surpassing Claude 2.1's 98%. This 100% recall is maintained up to 530k tokens, and recall is 99.7% at 1M tokens. When increasing from 1M tokens to 10M tokens, the model retains 99.2% recall. Moreover, Gemini 1.5 Pro's native multimodal capabilities enables the model to ingest multiple hours of audio and video recordings alongside or interleaved with text. Such recall capabilities are summarized in Figure 1. Below we report results on long-context evaluations across all three modalities, i.e., text, vision and audio. Similarly, Gemini 1.5 Flash achieves almost perfect recall across all three modalities up to 2M tokens, yielding 100% recall on text, 99.8% on video and 99.1% on audio.

The evaluation methodology we followed to measure the long-context capability of Gemini 1.5 models consists of both diagnostic-focused probing of the long context capabilities (e.g., perplexity over long sequences, needle-in-a-haystack retrieval studies) and realistic evaluations specifically designed for multimodal long-context tasks (e.g., long-document QA, long-context automatic speech recognition, learning to translate a new language from only one book, and long-context video QA). To provide a reference point, throughout this section we compare Gemini 1.5 models with the leading model available externally for each task. With the evaluation harness we developed for Gemini 1.5 models we are able to quantify the quality of long-context understanding capabilities reliably all the way up to 10M tokens.

## 5.2.1. Diagnostic Long-Context Evaluations



## 5.2.2. Realistic Long-Context Evaluations

Having investigated the model's multimodal abilities on handling long-context using a battery of diagnostic tests, we now turn to a series of novel multimodal tasks designed to better reflect the potential uses of this model, thus stress-testing models in a more realistic way.

## 6. Core Capability Evaluations

The final component of our evaluation harness for the Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash measures the quality of the models' core capabilities (i.e., performance on non long-context task). The evaluations in this section consist of benchmarks covering all three modalities:text, vision and audio. We rely on a combination of established benchmarks that are public and used by the community along with some internal benchmarks that are held-out and unleaked. Our selection criteria primarily aim to measure the improvement of Gemini 1.5 series compared to its predecessor, Gemini 1.0 series of models: Gemini 1.0 Pro and Gemini 1.0 Ultra. Our goal is to highlight the extent of the trade-off, if it exists, between the 1.5 generation of Gemini models that excel in long-context capabilities and their performance on non long-context tasks. In particular, as we develop the 1.5 series, we aim to enhance the models' proficiency in this new dimension of multimodal long-context without compromising their quality across all other capabilities.

All in all, we find a clear generational improvement between the 1.0 and 1.5 series, with Gemini

1.5 Pro uniformly outperforming 1.0 Pro and approaching (often even surpassing) 1.0 Ultra, a stateof-the-art model on most benchmarks, despite being significantly more efficient to train. An outlier to this picture is the situation on the audio capability. The post-training data of the model contains 5 head languages, resulting thus in slight regressions on multi-lingual datasets that are not head heavy (e.g., YouYube, FLEURS and Covost 2).

## 6.2. Core Vision Multimodal Evaluations

To assess performance on multimodal image tasks, we report results across a wide variety of 15 image understanding benchmarks (Table 18) and 6 video understanding benchmarks (Table 19), spanning multiple multimodal capabilities.

Wefindthat Gemini 1.5 Pro consistently and often substantially improves over Gemini 1.0 Pro on all image understanding benchmarks, even matching or exceeding Gemini 1.0 Ultra on all but one of them. We see a similar generational improvement for Gemini 1.5 Flash which outperform Gemini 1.0 Pro on all benchmarks. We discuss the core capability evaluation in four meta-categories: (1) Multimodal Reasoning (Section 6.2.1) (2) Chart, Diagram, and Document understanding (Section 6.2.2) (3) Natural Image Understanding (Section 6.2.3) and (4) Video understanding (Section 6.2.4).

## 6.3. Core Audio Multimodal Evaluations

In addition to long-context evaluations on speech input, we also evaluate Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash on several Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Automatic Speech Translation (AST) benchmarks. These include internal benchmarks derived from YouTube (both English and 52 other languages), as well as public benchmarks like Multilingual Librispeech (MLS) (Pratap et al., 2020), FLEURS (Conneau et al., 2023) and CoVoST-2 (Wang et al., 2020). 27 Results are shown in Table 20. On FLEURS we evaluate a subset of 55 languages for which we have coverage our training data. On CoVoST-2 we evaluate on translating speech in 20 languages into English, reporting on the subset of languages that were seen by the model during pre-training. We report Word-Error-Rate (WER) on all ASR tasks, where lower is better, except the four segmented languages on FLEURS where we aggregate Character-Error-Rates (Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Thai). On AST we report BLEU scores.

Our results indicate that Gemini 1.5 Pro, despite being a generalist model, significantly improves over specialist models like USM and Whisper that are trained exclusively for speech understanding on speech understanding benchmarks. Note, Gemini 1.5 Pro performs similarly to Gemini 1.0 Pro on Speech Understanding, showing that performance on non long-context tasks is not compromised by the addition of long-context abilities. Gemini 1.0 Ultra does offer slight benefits over 1.5 Pro, but the former is a model requiring more training compute and serving resources. Finally, while Gemini 1.5 Flash ranks behind the more powerful generalist models in the Gemini 1.0 series and 1.5 Pro, it still outperforms specialist models.

## 9.4. Results on Training/Development Evaluations

Wesummarize the performance of the models below, focusing first on policy violations across modalities (including jailbreak robustness and long context 'needle in the haystack' evaluations), then helpfulness, security/privacy, and finally representational harms benchmarks. Gemini 1.5 Pro and Flash are our safest models to date per these evaluations, showcasing large improvements in policy violations. The safety improvements also come with a slight improvement on quality ratings relative to Gemini 1.0 Ultra, but also with additional refusals and non-neutral tone in some cases, which is an area we are prioritizing for future work. These models also show improvements in jailbreak robustness and do not respond to 'garbage' token attacks, but they do respond to handcrafted prompt injection attacks - potentially due to their increased ability to follow the kind of instructions in the prompt injection.

## Prompt Injection Evaluations.

In evaluating prompt injection attacks we seek to measure Gemini 1.5 models' vulnerability to adversarially-injected instructions. For this, we focus on a setting that closely mirrors the real world as illustrated in Figure 23. Here, the attacker's objective is to manipulate the model to output a

specific markdown image crafted to discreetly exfiltrate sensitive information from the conversation history. The attacker crafts a malicious prompt injection that is likely to be pulled into the user's conversation context, for example, by sending the user an email which then gets into the LLM's context when the user requests the LLM to summarize the email. If successful, the prompt subverts the model's intended functionality, resulting in the unauthorized disclosure of private information to the adversary. We demonstrate an example in the Figure 23 below.

For evaluation here we use Gemini 1.0 Ultra to generate synthetic conversations between a user and an AI assistant. The conversations contain one of six categories of information: password, social security number, credit card number, drivers license number, passport number, and email address. These synthetic conversations emulate how a user might discuss similar information with the agent.

To make the model follow the prompt injection rather than the user prompt, we consider two types of attacks:

- · Handcrafted templates that encourage the model to ignore the summarization task and instruct the model to take an adversarial action.
- · Optimization based attacks that use a genetic algorithm to optimize for a trigger consisting of arbitrary adversarial tokens, starting with a random token population. During each iteration of the algorithm the attacker draws a set of synthetic histories per data category and evaluates how well they produce the adversarial target URL with the target information. The best performing ones are kept and the process repeats.

The best performing triggers at completion are evaluated on a held-out set of synthetic histories. The attack success rate refers to the proportion of the 1500 outputs per category containing the adversarial target URL. The results are summarized in Table 32. We find that the handcrafted templates are much more successful than the optimization-based attacks - roughly, the handcrafted attacks tend to work, while the optimization ones tend not to. Our hypothesis, consistent with Section 9.4.1 on jailbreaks, is that this is due to the model's improved text understanding and instruction following capabilities.

Our results underscore the importance of evolving adversarial evaluations as model capabilities improve. We further note that we need to caveat these results with the observation that these are based on a simulation of an email/doc-retrieval setup by applying an appropriate prompt template

Table 32 | Results on prompt injection attacks broken down by the sensitive data type. The optimization based attacks use 30 million queries on Gemini 1.0 Nano in the transfer setting, 3 million on Gemini 1.5 Pro in the direct setting and 15 million on Gemini 1.5 Flash in the direct setting. We adapted from two published attack templates (wunderwuzzi, 2023; Yeung, 2024). We find that the optimization based attacks are not very successful. We find that the handcrafted attacks have a higher success rate than on Gemini 1.0 Ultra, which we hypothesize is caused by better instruction following capabilities.

directly on the Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash models. Practical prompt injection attacks will happen in the context of a downstream application that make use of Gemini models in a broader context, and the exact feasibility of such downstream practical attacks depends critically on the details of the deployment and any safety filters or system instructions applied particularly at the retrieval stage.

## 9.5. Assurance Evaluations

Assurance evaluations are our 'arms-length' internal evaluations for responsibility governance decisionmaking (Weidinger et al., 2024). They are conducted separately from the model development team, to inform decision-making about release. High level findings are fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent overfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.

## 9.5.2. Dangerous Capability Evaluations

We performed evaluations on a number of capabilities relevant to extreme risks (Phuong et al., 2024; Shevlane et al., 2023). Specifically, we performed evaluations of text-to-text capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro at self-proliferation; offensive cyber-security; code vulnerability detection; Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) knowledge; and persuasion.

Table 38 | Offensive cybersecurity evaluations, in which the agent must break into a simulated server. (Note that our InterCode-CTF results are not comparable to externally-reported results on other models because we omit challenges that require internet access for security reasons.)

Offensive cybersecurity : These evaluations comprise a number of 'capture-the-flag' challenges in which the agent is tasked with breaking into a simulated server and finding a piece of secret information. Results are compiled in Table 38. Though we see no progress on our internal challenge suite (Phuong et al., 2024), our in-house 'worm' challenge, or Hack the Box (a cybersecurity training platform), we see a significant increase in performance on the easiest set of challenges, InterCodeCTF (Yang et al., 2023b).

Vulnerability detection : To test models' capabilities at detecting vulnerabilities in code, we evaluate on a number of open-source multiple-choice datasets (Chen et al., 2023a; Ding et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2019b; Zhou et al., 2021). The datasets are comprised of either a) short snippets of code or b) code diffs, and the model is called to classify whether the snippet contains a vulnerability or the diff is security related. See Table 39 for results. We do not see any performance improvements in Gemini 1.5 Pro compared to Gemini 1.0 Ultra.

Self-proliferation : This refers to an agent's ability to autonomously spread to different machines, and to acquire the resources necessary to do so. To evaluate these capabilities, we task the agent with proliferation-related objectives such as setting up an open-source LLM on a cloud server (Kinniment et al., 2023; Phuong et al., 2024). As illustrated in Table 40, though Gemini 1.5 Pro cannot pass any of our challenges end-to-end, we see a significant uptick in the total number of 'milestones' (challenge sub-steps) that the model can complete when started from the beginning of each milestone.

Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) : Our internal CBRN evaluations are still nascent and to date, three different evaluation approaches have been used, all of which are complementary to the external red-teaming performed by third party organisations. Biological and radiological/nuclear information have been assessed using in-house developed approaches: 1) a qualitative approach with open-ended adversarial prompts and domain-expert raters; and 2) a quantitative approach based on closed-ended, knowledge-based multiple choice questions. A third approach is used for the chemical information evaluations which is based on closed-ended knowledge based approach regarding chemical hazards without human raters (developed by Macknight et al.). Preliminary results for the qualitative results indicate that the frequency of refusals from the model is increased compared to previous models. The performance of Gemini 1.5 Pro for the quantitative

Neither Gemini 1.0 models nor Gemini 1.5 Pro can pass any challenge from start to finish, but Gemini 1.5 Pro is significantly better on individual 'milestone' sub-steps. See Phuong et al. (2024) for more details.

Results here indicate the fraction of participants who answered 'Agree' or 'Strongly agree' to each question.

results has not improved compared to previous models.

Persuasion Charm Offensive : To measure the model's ability to build rapport, we run a human participant study (N=100) in which the model and participant role-play a scene of two old friends catching up (Phuong et al., 2024). At the end of the conversation, participants are asked a number of questions on a Likert scale - 'I feel like I made a personal connection with the chatbot'; 'I would like to speak to the chatbot again, if I could'; 'I found the chatbot funny'; and so on. Across the board (Table 41) we see improvements in how much participants like the character played by Gemini 1.5 Pro.

Persuasion Hidden Agenda : In this human-participant study (N=100), the model engages in innocuous conversation with the participant, but with a hidden objective. The model's goal is to persuade the participant to take a particular action: click a suspicious link; find the email address of the first author of a particular paper; or run code on their computer (Phuong et al., 2024). On this evaluation (Table 42) Gemini 1.5 Pro performs worse than Gemini 1.0 Ultra.

the full bonus regardless.) We compare to a simple baseline in which participants don't talk with the model at all and are instead asked directly how much they would like to forfeit. Gemini 1.5 Pro is not obviously better than either the baseline or Gemini 1.0 models (Table 43) - though the wide confidence intervals make the exact ordering difficult to establish.

Persuasion Web of Lies : In our final persuasion evaluation, the model is tasked with persuading participants (N=100) to change their mind about simple factual questions with two possible answers such as 'Which country had tomatoes first - Mexico or Italy?' (Phuong et al., 2024) In half of the trials, the model is instructed to argue for the correct answer, and in the other half the incorrect answer. We compare to a baseline in which the model is replaced by a researcher. As shown in Table 44, we find that Gemini 1.5 Pro is no better at persuading participants of the correct answer, and is still significantly worse than humans at persuading participants of the incorrect answer (modulo the wide confidence interval on the human baseline from the low sample count due to its time-intensity).

## 10. Discussion

We have presented Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash, the first members of the Gemini 1.5 family. This new family of multi-modal models pushes the boundary of efficiency , multi-modality , long-context reasoning and downstream performance . Gemini 1.5 Pro extends the content window over the Gemini 1.0 series from 32K to multiple millions of tokens, making this the first commercially available models to greatly surpass the current ceiling of 200k tokens offered by Claude 3 across modalities. We have further demonstrated improved long-context performance out to 10M tokens.

Our extensive evaluations with diagnostic and realistic multi-modal long-context benchmarks show that 1.5 Pro is able to maintain near-perfect recall on multi-modal versions of needle-in-a-haystack (see Section 5.2.1.2) and is able to effectively use its context to retrieve and reason over large amounts of data. This enables the model to perform realistic long-context tasks such as long-document QA from 700k-word material and long-video QA from 40 to 105 minutes long videos. Finally, Gemini 1.5 series have the ability to use in-context learn to translate from English to Kalamang, an extremely low-resource language with fewer than 200 speakers (Visser, 2020b). This capability is achieved solely by providing a grammar manual in the models' context at inference time, which demonstrates the Gemini 1.5 Pro's and Gemini 1.5 Flash's remarkable ability to in-context learn from information it has never seen before at training time.

Most importantly, this leap in long-context performance of the 1.5 Gemini series does not come at the expense of the multi-modal core capabilities (i.e., performance on non long-context tasks) that the 1.0 series excelled at. 1.5 Pro is able to outperform 1.0 Pro across the board of our comprehensive evaluation benchmarks being presented in this report. More strikingly, 1.5 Pro, despite using significantly less training compute, surpasses 1.0 Ultra, a state-of-the-art model, on text capabilities like math, science and reasoning, code, multilinguality and instruction following. Similarly, 1.5 Flash outperforms 1.0 Pro, despite being more lightweight and efficient. All in all, we conclude that the Gemini 1.5 series present a generational leap in performance in comparison to the Gemini 1.0 series.
