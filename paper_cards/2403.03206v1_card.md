# Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis

# Research questions
Q1: What benefit does the novel rectified flow formulation achieve over existing diffusion formulations for high-resolution text-to-image synthesis?

Contribution: We introduce a re-weighting of noise scales in rectified flow models, improving its performance compared to existing diffusion formulations and demonstrating its benefits through a large-scale study.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
**
* Introduction of advanced code-focused LLMs for software development
* Development of repository-level data construction during pre-training
* Extensive evaluations demonstrating superiority over existing open-source models

#### Keywords: Rectified Flow, Diffusion Models, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Transformer-Based Architecture, Scalable Generative Modeling, Latent Diffusion Models
