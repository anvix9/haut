# Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis

# Research questions
Q1: Can rectified flow models be trained more efficiently by biasing noise sampling towards perceptually relevant scales?

Contribution: This work presents a novel approach for training rectified flow models by introducing new noise samplers and demonstrating its benefits compared to established diffusion formulations, with improved performance on high-resolution text-to-image synthesis tasks.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

  + Improved training efficiency of rectified flow models with biasing technique
  + Demonstrated superiority of proposed approach over established diffusion formulations in high-resolution text-to-image synthesis

#### Keywords: Diffusion Models, Rectified Flow, Natural Language Processing, Transformers, Perceptual Data Synthesis
