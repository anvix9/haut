# Zephyr: Direct Distillation of LM Alignment

# Research questions
Based on this passage, here are the research questions:

**Q1:** Can a small open Large Language Model (LLM) be aligned to user intent through distilled direct preference optimization (dDPO), and if so, how effective is it in improving task accuracy?

**Q2:** Does the proposed approach of utilizing AI Feedback (AIF) as preference data for distillation improve the intent alignment of smaller LLMs compared to existing methods?

**Q3:** Can a 7B parameter model be trained using dDPO to achieve performance comparable to larger, open-access models aligned with human feedback?

The main problem being addressed is the issue of intent alignment in small open LLMs, which is currently a significant challenge in natural language processing. The authors aim to improve the alignement property through distillation methods.

The study seeks to address the following implicit questions:

* Can we use AI Feedback as a substitute for human annotation and sampling-based approaches?
* Is it possible to develop a method that can effectively transfer conversational capabilities from larger models to smaller ones?
* What are the limitations of using dDPO in aligning LLMs, and how do they impact the performance of the resulting model?

The study aims to provide insights into these questions and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, ZEPHYR-7B, which sets a new state-of-the-art for 7B parameter chat models.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

  • Scalable and efficient method for distilling conversational capabilities from larger models.
  • Improved intent alignment in smaller LLMs using preference data and direct optimization techniques.
