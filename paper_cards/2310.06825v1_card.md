# Research questions
Based on the passage, here are the main research questions and explicit or implicit questions raised:

Q1: Can language models be designed to balance high-level performance and efficiency while keeping computational costs and inference latency at bay?

Q2: How can researchers create more affordable, efficient, and high-performing language models that can be used in a wide range of real-world applications?

Implicit question:
Q3: What are the limitations and assumptions underlying current scaling laws for language models (e.g., 2D scaling laws), and how can these be addressed to optimize performance-inference tradeoff?

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
**
• Developed efficient language model with reduced inference latency.
• Improved understanding of sequence handling in large language models.
