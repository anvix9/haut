# Research questions
Q1: What language models can efficiently deliver both high-level performance and efficiency without escalating computational costs and inference latency?

Q2: How do grouped-query attention (GQA) and sliding window attention (SWA) contribute to the enhanced performance and efficiency of a language model like Mistral 7B?

Q3: What are the primary benefits of releasing language models under open-source licenses, such as Apache 2.0, in terms of promoting community adoption and collaboration?
