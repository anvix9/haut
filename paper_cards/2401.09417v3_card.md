# Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model

# Research questions
Based on the provided passage, the main research question being addressed by the authors can be summarized in the following clear and concise terms:

Q1: Is it possible to design a generic and efficient vision backbone using state space models (SSMs) that can handle long-range visual dependencies without relying on self-attention mechanisms?

Q2: Can we leverage the recent advances in SSMs, such as Mamba, to develop a pure-SSM-based model for visual representation learning that surpasses the performance of existing Transformer-based models like DeiT?

The authors aim to address these questions by proposing the Vision Mamba (Vim) model, which incorporates bidirectional SSMs for data-dependent global visual context modeling and position embeddings for location-aware visual recognition.

Contribution: The authors' main contribution is the proposal and evaluation of the Vision Mamba (Vim) model, a pure-SSM-based backbone that achieves superior performance compared to DeiT on image classification tasks while offering better efficiency in terms of GPU memory and inference time for high-resolution images.
