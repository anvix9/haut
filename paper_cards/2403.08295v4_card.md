# Gemma: Open Models Based on Gemini Research and Technology

# Research questions
Q1: What is the primary goal or objective of the research paper that introduces Gemma models?

Q2: How do Gemma models address current challenges associated with large language model development and deployment?

Q3: What specific techniques or architectures were used to develop the Gemma models, and how do they compare to existing models like Gemini?

Q4: What safety and responsibility aspects of LLMs are being addressed through the release of pre-trained and fine-tuned checkpoints for Gemma models?

Contribution: This work introduces Gemma, a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models built from the research and technology used to create Gemini models.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
 
  - Introduce DeepSeek-Coder series with improved code completion capabilities
  - Develop repository-level data construction during pre-training for cross-file code generation
  - Demonstrate superiority over existing open-source models in various benchmarks

#### Keywords: Natural Language Processing, Transformer Models, Large Scale Language Understanding
