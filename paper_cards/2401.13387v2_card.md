# A Mathematical Theory of Semantic Communication

# Research questions
The research question addressed by the authors can be summarized as follows:

Q1: Can we develop a systematic framework for understanding semantic information theory (SIT) and its applications in communication?

Q2: How can we establish a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between classic information theory (CIT) and SIT, enabling better performance potential for future communication techniques?

The motivations behind this study seem to be:

* To extend the limits of CIT, which has been instrumental in modern communication techniques
* To explore the behavior of semantic communication, focusing on synonym as a basic feature
* To develop new measures of semantic information and establish theoretical frameworks for SIT

Implicit questions raised by the authors include:

* How can we define a framework that captures the essence of SIT and its potential applications?
* Can we provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between semantic information, syntactic information, and communication techniques?

The authors also aim to contribute to the development of SIT by introducing new measures of semantic information (semantic entropy, mutual information, capacity, and rate-distortion function), proving coding theorems for SIT, and exploring its applications in continuous cases.
