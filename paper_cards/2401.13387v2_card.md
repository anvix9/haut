# A Mathematical Theory of Semantic Communication

# Research questions
Q1: What is the definition of semantic information theory (SIT) and its core concept of synonymous mapping between semantic information and syntactic information?

Q2: How does the authors propose to establish a systematic framework for SIT by investigating the behavior of semantic communication and identifying key measures such as semantic entropy, semantic mutual information, and semantic rate-distortion function?

Q3: What are the coding theorems of SIT that have been proven in this paper using random coding and typical decoding/encoding methods?

Contribution: The authors have made a significant contribution by proposing a new theoretical framework for SIT, which extends the limits of classic information theory (CIT) and may reveal great performance potential for future communication systems.

Note: There is no specific question or research question being asked in the passage, but rather an introduction to the concept of SIT and its underlying ideas. The contributions and technical advancements mentioned at the end provide a clear direction for the research, but they do not constitute a specific research question itself.
