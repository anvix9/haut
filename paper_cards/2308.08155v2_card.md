# AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation

# Research questions
Q1: What is the primary goal of this research in developing a multi-agent conversation framework for large language models (LLMs)?

The researchers aim to facilitate the development of LLM applications that can span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities using a multi-agent approach, leveraging recent advances in LLMs.

Q2: What problem or challenge does the proposed AutoGen framework seek to address?

The AutoGen framework addresses two critical questions:

1. How can we design individual agents that are capable, reusable, customizable, and effective in multi-agent collaboration?
2. How can we develop a straightforward, unified interface that can accommodate a wide range of agent conversation patterns?

By addressing these questions, the researchers hope to create a generic framework for building diverse applications of various complexities and LLM capacities.

Contribution: The AutoGen framework is designed to provide a flexible and modular platform for developing multi-agent applications that leverage LLMs. By combining customizable agents with conversation programming, it aims to simplify complex LLM application workflows and enable innovative ways of using LLMs while reducing development effort.
