# AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation

# Research questions
Q1: What framework is proposed to facilitate the development of Large Language Model (LLM) applications that span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities based on multi-agent approaches?

Contribution: AutoGen is presented as an open-source, generalized multi-agent conversation framework designed to enable developers to build diverse applications using LLMs, humans, or tools exhibiting different capacities.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
**
• Introducing AutoGen as a generalized multi-agent conversation framework for building diverse LLM applications.
• Development of repository-level data construction during pre-training to boost cross-file code generation capabilities.

#### Keywords: Multi-Agent Framework, Conversational AI, Large Language Models, Agent Design, Conversation Programming
