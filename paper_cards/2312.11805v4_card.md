# Gemini: A Family of Highly Capable Multimodal Models

# Research questions
Q1: Can Gemini, a family of highly capable multimodal models, be fine-tuned to achieve human-expert performance in various reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency for on-device applications? 

This report introduces the Gemini family of multimodal models, which exhibit remarkable capabilities across image, audio, video, and text understanding. The authors aim to develop a model that can handle complex reasoning tasks while being computationally efficient for use cases with limited memory resources. They achieve this by creating three sizes of models (Ultra, Pro, and Nano) tailored to address different application requirements and computational limitations.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
**
* Developed the Gemini family of multimodal models for complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.
* Introduced adaptive configurations to accommodate different requirements and limitations.

#### Keywords: Multimodal Models, Cross-Modal Reasoning, Large-Scale Language Modeling, Image Understanding, Audio Processing
