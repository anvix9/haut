# Mixtral of Experts

# Research questions
After carefully reading the passage, I've identified the main research question being addressed as follows:

Q1: How can a sparse mixture-of-experts (SMoE) language model, Mixtral 8x7B, be designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while using only a fraction of its total parameters?

Q2: Can a more efficient and scalable variant of the SMoE architecture, which incorporates fine-tuning for instruction-following tasks, outperform existing models on human evaluation benchmarks and improve upon latency and inference speed?

The research question seems to be focused on addressing two main objectives:

1. Design an efficient and scalable language model that can achieve competitive performance with state-of-the-art models while reducing the computational overhead.
2. Fine-tune a variant of this model for instruction-following tasks, demonstrating improved performance, reduced bias, and better inference speed.

The authors aim to provide a solution by introducing Mixtral 8x7B, which achieves these objectives through its use of sparse mixture-of-experts architecture, fine-tuning, and efficient inference methods.
