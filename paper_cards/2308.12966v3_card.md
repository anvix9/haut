# Qwen-VL: A Versatile Vision-Language Model for Understanding, Localization, Text Reading, and Beyond

# Research questions
Q1: What are the key vision-language models introduced in this paper, and how do they differ from existing models?

A: The authors introduce the Qwen-VL series, a set of large-scale multilingual vision-language models that aim to facilitate multimodal research. These models are designed to perceive and understand both texts and images, achieving top-tier accuracy on various vision-centric understanding benchmarks.

Q2: What specific features does the Qwen-VL series possess, and how do they enhance the capabilities of existing vision-language models?

A: The Qwen-VL series includes several key features, such as leading performance, multi-lingual support, multi-image interleaved conversations, fine-grained visual understanding, grounding in Chinese, and fine-grained dialog performance. These features enable the models to excel in various tasks, including image captioning, question answering, text-oriented question answering, and visual grounding.

Q3: How do the Qwen-VL series models differ from existing proprietary vision-language models?

A: The authors highlight that current open-source vision-language models lag behind proprietary models due to inadequate training and optimization. The Qwen-VL series aims to bridge this gap by introducing a new visual receptor, 3-stage training pipeline, and multilingual multimodal cleaned corpus.

Q4: What future directions does the research team plan to explore for the Qwen-VL series?

A: The authors outline plans to integrate Qwen-VL with more modalities, such as speech and video, augment the model by scaling up size and data, and expand its capabilities in multi-modal generation.

C Contribution: In this work, we introduce the Qwen-VL series, a set of large-scale vision-language models that demonstrate promising potential in solving real-world vision-central problems.
