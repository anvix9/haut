# Stable Video Diffusion: Scaling Latent Video Diffusion Models to Large Datasets

# Research questions
Q1: What three distinct stages does the researchers identify as crucial for successful training of video LDMs?

A1: The researchers identify three different stages for successful training of video LDMs: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining on a large dataset at low resolution, and high-quality video finetuning on a much smaller dataset with higher-quality videos.

Q2: What is the proposed method to curate vast amounts of video data and turn large and noisy video collections into suitable datasets for generative video models?

A2: The researchers propose a systematic approach to curation that involves selecting well-curated datasets, scaling down low-resolution data, and filtering high-quality videos.

Q3: What are the core contributions of the research paper?

A3: The researchers present threefold core contributions: (i) they introduce a systematic data curation workflow for generative video modeling; (ii) they train state-of-the-art text-to-video and image-to-video models using this workflow, outperforming prior models; and (iii) they explore the strong prior of motion and 3D understanding in their models.

Q4: What is the significance of pretraining on a large and diverse dataset followed by finetuning on a smaller but higher quality dataset for generative models?

A4: The researchers highlight that pretraining on a large and diverse dataset and finetuning on a smaller but higher quality dataset significantly improves the performance of generative models, as demonstrated in prior research for generative image modeling.

Q5: What are the key findings of the study regarding the effect of data curation during video pretraining?

A5: The researchers demonstrate that pretraining on well-curated datasets leads to significant performance improvements that persist after high-quality finetuning.
