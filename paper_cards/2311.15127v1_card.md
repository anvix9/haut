# Stable Video Diffusion: Scaling Latent Video Diffusion Models to Large Datasets

# Research questions
Q1: What are the three distinct stages for successful training of video Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) identified by the authors, and what are their contributions to improving performance? 

Contribution: The authors identify three crucial stages for training video LDMs: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining on a large dataset at low resolution, and high-quality video finetuning on a smaller dataset with higher-quality videos. They demonstrate that these stages are essential for achieving state-of-the-art performance in generative video modeling. 

Q2: What is the main finding regarding the effect of data curation during video pretraining, and what implications does it have for the training of video models? 

Contribution: The authors find that pretraining on well-curated datasets leads to significant performance improvements that persist after high-quality finetuning. This suggests that carefully selecting and curating video data is crucial for achieving optimal results in generative video modeling.

Q3: What are the key contributions of the Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model, and what does it provide as a base for downstream tasks? 

Contribution: The authors present SVD, a latent video diffusion model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-video synthesis. They demonstrate that SVD provides a powerful motion representation and can be finetuned for various applications, including image-to-video synthesis, camera control using LoRAs, and multi-view synthesis.
