# Stable Video Diffusion: Scaling Latent Video Diffusion Models to Large Datasets

# Research questions
Here is a clear and concise summary of the main research question addressed by the authors:

**Research Question 1:** What are the optimal stages for training video Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to achieve high-quality generative video synthesis?

**Research Question 2:** How does data curation affect the performance of video LDMs, and what is a systematic approach to curate large datasets for generative video models?

**Implicit Research Questions:**

* Can pretraining on a large, diverse dataset followed by finetuning on a smaller but higher-quality dataset improve the performance of video LDMs?
* How does the training scheme and architecture of the LDM affect its ability to generate high-quality videos?
* What is the importance of data selection in generating high-quality videos using video LDMs?

The authors aim to address these questions by proposing three distinct stages for training video LDMs: text-to-image pretraining, video pretraining on a large dataset at low resolution, and high-resolution video finetuning on a much smaller dataset with higher-quality videos. They also introduce a systematic approach to curate vast amounts of video data and present an empirical study on the effect of data curation during video pretraining.

**Contribution:** The authors contribute to the field of generative video modeling by:

* Presenting a systematic data curation workflow to turn large uncurated video collections into quality datasets for generative video modeling.
* Training state-of-the-art text-to-video and image-to-video models using their proposed method.
* Probing the strong prior of motion and 3D understanding in their models through domain-specific experiments.

The findings of this study aim to provide a better understanding of the importance of data curation in generating high-quality videos using video LDMs and to provide a pioneering study on multi-view finetuning of video diffusion models.
