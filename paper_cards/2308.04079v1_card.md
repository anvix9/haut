# 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering

# Research questions
Q1: Can radiance field methods achieve high visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and enabling real-time rendering at 1080p resolution for unbounded and complete scenes?

Q2: What novel representation can be used to combine the benefits of point-based meshes and continuous scene representations, allowing for optimization with state-of-the-art visual quality and competitive training times?

Contribution: The authors introduce three key elements that enable high-quality radiance field methods to achieve real-time rendering at 1080p resolution while maintaining competitive training times. These elements include (1) a 3D Gaussian representation of scenes that preserves desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields, (2) an optimization method for the properties of the 3D Gaussians that creates high-quality representations for captured scenes, and (3) a fast rendering solution using tile-based splatting with visibility-aware anisotropic splatting.

  • Novel representation combining point-based meshes and continuous scene representations (3D Gaussians)
  • Optimization method for 3D Gaussians achieving high-quality scene representations
  • Fast rendering solution using tile-based splatting with visibility-aware anisotropic splatting
