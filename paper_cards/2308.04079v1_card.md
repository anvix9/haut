# 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering

# Research questions
Q1: Can novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos be achieved with real-time display rates at high resolution (1080p), and if so, what techniques enable efficient optimization and rendering?

Q2: How do the introduced methods (novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos) allow for the trade-off between speed and quality in radiance field representations, enabling competitive training times and real-time rendering while maintaining state-of-the-art visual quality?

Contribution: Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. The authors introduce three key elements that allow them to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allowing high-quality real-time (â‰¥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution.
