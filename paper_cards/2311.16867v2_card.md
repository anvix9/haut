# The Falcon Series of Open Language Models

        # Research questions
        Q1: How do increasingly large-scale language models achieve emergent capabilities that can be tailored to human preference?

Answer: Increasingly large-scale language models, such as the Falcon series, give rise to so-called emergent capabilities that can be further tailored to human preference, enabling the construction of instruction-following or chatty models.

        ## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
        
  • Introducing the Falcon series of causal decoder-only models.
  • Developing repository-level data construction during pre-training, which significantly boosts cross-file code generation capabilities.
