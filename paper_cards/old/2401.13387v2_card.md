# A Mathematical Theory of Semantic Communication

# Research questions
Q1: What is the theoretic framework for semantic information theory (SIT) that extends classic information theory (CIT), and what are its key features?

Contribution: The authors propose a systematic framework for SIT, introducing measures of semantic information such as semantic entropy, up/down semantic mutual information, semantic capacity, and semantic rate-distortion function. They also prove three coding theorems for SIT, which provide theoretical limits on its performance.

The problem that the authors aim to solve can be stated as:

Q2: How can we develop a comprehensive theory of semantic communication that leverages classic information theory, while accounting for the nuances of meaning and context in natural language?
