# AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation

# Research questions
Q1: How can a multi-agent conversation framework with customizable and conversable agents facilitate the development of LLM applications that can span a broad spectrum of domains and complexities?

Contribution: AutoGen is an open-source framework that enables developers to build LLM applications via multiple, conversable agents that collaborate to accomplish tasks. It provides a generic framework for building diverse applications with varying levels of complexity and LLM capacities.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

• Introduction of specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) for coding, including DeepSeek-Coder series.
• Development of repository-level data construction during pre-training to boost cross-file code generation capabilities.

#### Keywords: Multi-Agent Conversation Framework, Large Language Model Applications, Conversable Agents, Conversation Programming, LLM-based Reasoning
