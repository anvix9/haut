# A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions

# Research questions
Q1: What are the main challenges posed by hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) and how do they impact information retrieval systems?

Contribution: The emergence of LLMs has marked a significant breakthrough in natural language processing, but they are prone to generating hallucinations, which can lead to misleading information and compromise the reliability of real-world information retrieval systems. 

This question highlights the primary research problem addressed by this study, focusing on the challenges posed by hallucinations in LLMs and their impact on information retrieval systems.

Note: I have rephrased the contribution section to match the format required. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results
**
Established a comprehensive understanding of LLM hallucinations, identified key factors contributing to these issues, developed detection methods, and proposed mitigations strategies for LLMs.
