# The Llama 3 Herd of Models

# Research questions
Q1: What are the primary focus areas for improving high-quality foundation models, according to the study?

Contribution: The researchers focused on optimizing three key levers in developing high-quality foundation models: data, scale, and managing complexity.

Answer: The main research question is how to optimize foundation models for high-quality performance by fine-tuning data, scaling up the model size, and simplifying the development process.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

* Introduction of DeepSeek-Coder-Base and DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct LLMs.
* Development of repository-level data construction during pre-training.
* Extensive evaluations demonstrating superiority over existing models.

#### Keywords: Multilingual, Foundation Models, Natural Language Processing, Large Language Model, Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Models
