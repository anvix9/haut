# 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering

# Research questions
Q1: Can a real-time novel-view synthesis system achieve high-quality visual results for unbounded and complete scenes at 1080p resolution using only 3D Gaussian representations, without the need for expensive neural network training or complex optimization processes? 

Contribution: The authors introduce three key elements that enable state-of-the-art (SOTA) visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and allowing high-quality real-time novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution.

## Problem Statement, Methods and Main Results

* Introduced a series of specialized LLMs for coding, providing advancements in open-source code modeling.
* Provided competitive method for real-time radiance field rendering, overcoming previous limitations in speed and quality.
* Enhanced training times and enabled high-quality real-time novel-view synthesis at 108p resolution using only 3D Gaussian representations.
