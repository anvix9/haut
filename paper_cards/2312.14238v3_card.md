# InternVL: Scaling up Vision Foundation Models and Aligning for Generic Visual-Linguistic Tasks

# Research questions
**Research Question:**

Q1: How can we bridge the gap between vision foundation models and large language models (LLMs) by developing a large-scale vision-language foundation model that aligns the representation of the scaled-up vision encoder with LLMs?

Q2: What are the key design elements necessary to train a large-scale vision-language foundation model, and how do they contribute to its effectiveness in various visual and vision-language tasks?

Q3: How can we effectively represent users' commands and align the representations between the vision encoder and LLM in a vision-language foundation model?

**Motivations Behind the Study:**

The study aims to address the limitations of existing vision and vision-language foundation models, which have not kept pace with the rapid growth of large language models. The authors aim to develop a large-scale vision-language foundation model that bridges this gap by:

* Scaling up the vision encoder to 6 billion parameters
* Aligning its representation with LLMs through progressive image-text alignment
* Leveraging web-scale noisy image-text data for efficient training

**Implicit Questions Raised:**

While not explicitly stated, some implicit questions raised in the study include:

* How can we effectively represent the complexity of visual and linguistic features in a vision-language foundation model?
* What are the optimal parameters and training strategies for large-scale vision-language foundation models?
* How can we ensure that the alignment between the vision encoder and LLM is consistent across different tasks and domains?

**Contribution:**

The study's primary contribution is the development of InternVL, a large-scale vision-language foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various visual and vision-language tasks. The study also introduces a progressive image-text alignment strategy for efficient training of large-scale vision-language foundation models, which maximizes the utilization of web-scale noisy image-text data.

The three-fold contribution of the study is:

1. Development of InternVL, a large-scale vision-language foundation model that aligns the representation of the scaled-up vision encoder with LLMs.
2. Introduction of a progressive image-text alignment strategy for efficient training of large-scale vision-language foundation models.
3. Extensive comparison of the proposed model with current state-of-the-art vision foundation models and VLLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in various visual and vision-language tasks.
