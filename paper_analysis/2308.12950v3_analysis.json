    "research": "Q1: Can a large language model be specialized for code generation and infilling, enabling applications such as real-time completion in source code editors or docstring generation?\n\nQ2: How can a large language model be fine-tuned to operate on very large contexts with a moderate impact on performance on standard coding benchmarks?\n\nContribution: We release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code generation and infilling derived from Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) and released under the same custom permissive license. Our approach is based on gradually specializing and increasing the capabilities of Llama 2 models by applying a cascade of training and fine-tuning steps, including code-training, infilling, long input contexts, and instruction fine-tuning.",
    "method": "Methodology: The authors employed a range of methodological approaches to develop and evaluate the performance of their Code Llama family of large language models. The key methodological approach used by the authors is based on the design, training, and evaluation of these models.\n\nThe primary data source for training the models is sequences of 16k tokens, which are then evaluated on a range of code benchmarks, including HumanEval and MBPP. The models are designed to support infilling capabilities, with the ability to fill in missing code snippets based on surrounding content.\n\nSpecifically, the authors employed several techniques:\n\n1. **Model Architecture**: A family of large language models was developed, including Code Llama, Code Llama - Python, and Code Llama - Instruct, each with varying parameter sizes (7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B).\n2. **Training Data**: The models were trained on sequences of 16k tokens, which demonstrated improvements in performance on inputs with up to 100k tokens.\n3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The authors used a range of evaluation metrics, including scores on HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, as well as the MultiPL-E benchmark.\n\nThe hypotheses tested by the authors appear to be centered around the ability of these models to:\n\n1. Demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on code benchmarks\n2. Support infilling capabilities for missing code snippets\n3. Provide zero-shot instruction following ability for programming tasks\n\nExperimental setups used in this study include training and evaluation of the models on various benchmarks, including HumanEval, MBPP, and MultiPL-E.\n\nComputational methods employed by the authors include:\n\n1. **Model Training**: The models were trained using a range of techniques, including sequence-to-sequence models.\n2. **Evaluation**: The performance of the models was evaluated using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.\n\nThe models align with research objectives by providing a novel approach to language modeling for code-based tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, and supporting infilling capabilities for missing code snippets.",
    "results": "Results: \n\nThe key findings reported by the authors are:\n\n* The authors release Code Llama, a family of large language models for code with state-of-the-art performance among open models.\n* Four variants of the model are provided, including foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B parameters each.\n* The models achieve improvements on inputs with up to 100k tokens and demonstrate infilling capabilities based on surrounding content.\n* Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art performance among open models on several code benchmarks, outperforming other publicly available models.\n* The authors provide a permissive license for the model's use.\n\nThese results contribute to addressing the research question by demonstrating the potential of large language models in code understanding and generation. By providing a family of models with different capabilities, the authors advance the field by showcasing the versatility and effectiveness of Code Llama in various applications, from infilling and large context fine-tuning to instruction following and benchmark performance."
