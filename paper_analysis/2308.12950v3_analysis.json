    "research": "Q1: Can a large language model be trained to generate code and fill in missing parts of code, while taking into account the surrounding context?\n\nContribution: We release Code Llama , a family of large language models for code generation and infilling derived from Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) and released under the same custom permissive license.",
    "method": "Methodology: The authors employed a range of techniques to address their research question, primarily focusing on developing and training large language models for code understanding and generation.\n\nThe key methodological approach used by the authors involves:\n\n* Large-scale model development: Trained multiple variants of large language models (LLama 2) with varying parameter sizes (7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B) to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.\n* Token-based training: Utilized sequences of up to 16k tokens for training the models, showcasing their ability to handle longer input contexts.\n* Infilling capabilities: Incorporated infilling abilities into three variants (7B, 13B, and 70B Code Llama, and Code Llama-Instruct), allowing them to leverage surrounding content for predictions.\n* Evaluation metrics: Used various benchmark scores, including HumanEval, MBPP, MultiPL-E, and comparing performance against other publicly available models.\n\nSpecifically, the authors tested hypotheses regarding the effectiveness of their approach, particularly:\n\n* Can large language models be trained to perform well on code understanding tasks?\n* How do parameter sizes impact model performance?\n* Do infilling capabilities improve overall model performance?\n\nBy training and evaluating these large language models using various techniques and metrics, the authors aimed to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance among open models and provide a solid foundation for future research in this area.",
    "results": "Results: The main findings of the paper are that:\n\n* Code Llama, a family of large language models for code, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several code benchmarks with scores up to 67% and 65%.\n* The model outperforms other publicly available models on various benchmarks, including MultiPL-E.\n* The models support infilling capabilities and can handle large input contexts, with the largest model (70B) achieving state-of-the-art results on standard Python completion benchmarks.\n* Despite some minor losses on left-to-right code generation benchmarks, the models remain competitive compared to other public models.\n* The Code Llama - Instruct variant demonstrates zero-shot instruction ability and provides a safer model to use and deploy.\n\nThese results contribute to addressing the research question by providing a robust and versatile language model for programming tasks, with significant improvements over existing models. The findings also highlight the importance of considering both performance and safety in large language models, with further work needed to improve the models' understanding of context and nuance in their instructions."
