    "method": "Methodology: .... We present Text2Room \u2020 , a method for generating roomscale textured 3D meshes from a given text prompt as input.\n\nWe leverage pre-trained 2D text-to-image models to synthesize a sequence of images from different poses. To lift these outputs into a consistent 3D scene representation, we combine monocular depth estimation with a text-conditioned inpainting model.\n\nThe core idea of our approach is a tailored viewpoint selection such that the content of each image can be fused into a seamless, textured 3D mesh. We propose a continuous alignment strategy that iteratively fuses scene frames with the existing geometry to create a seamless mesh.\n\nOur method uses the following techniques:\n\n*   Monocular depth estimation: This technique allows us to estimate depth information from a single camera view.\n*   Text-conditioned inpainting model: This technique enables us to fill in missing regions in an image using text prompts.\n*   Iterative scene generation scheme: This approach involves rendering the current mesh from novel viewpoints, filling in holes via inpainting, and merging generated content into the mesh.\n\nThe key components of our method include:\n\n1.  Depth alignment\n2.  Mesh fusion\n3.  Two-stage viewpoint selection\n\nThese components work together to create seamless and undistorted scene geometry and textures, while also generating complete scenes without holes.",
    "results": "Results: \nOur main findings are:\n\n1. **Successful generation of textured 3D meshes**: Our approach successfully generates room-scale 3D meshes with compelling textures and geometry from arbitrary text prompts.\n2. **Improved iterative fusion strategy**: We propose a tailored viewpoint selection strategy that iteratively fuses scene frames into a seamless mesh, allowing for the creation of complete 3D scenes with multiple objects and explicit geometry.\n\nOur results contribute to addressing the challenge of generating large-scale 3D models from text by:\n\n1. Demonstrating the feasibility of generating room-scale 3D geometry from only text input.\n2. Advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D model generation from text by proposing a novel iterative fusion strategy that enables seamless mesh creation.\n\nOverall, our results show promise for democratizing content creation in various applications, including AR/VR asset creation and computer graphics."
