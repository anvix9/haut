Our findings reveal that the fully-connected vision-language connector in LLaVA is surprisingly powerful and data-efficient, achieving state-of-the-art results across 11 benchmarks with simple modifications such as using CLIP-ViT-L-336px with an MLP projection and adding academic-task-oriented VQA data with response formatting prompts. We also explore open problems in LMMs, including scaling to higher resolution inputs, compositional capabilities, and model hallucination, providing insights into the optimal design choices for large multimodal models in visual instruction tuning.\n\nNote: The research question is not directly asking about a specific problem but rather about the optimal design choices for LMMs. However, based on the context provided, we can infer that one of the main contributions of this study is to provide guidance on how to train LMMs effectively and efficiently.",
    "method": "Methodology: We employed a large multimodal model (LMM) approach under the LLaVA framework, utilizing CLIP-ViT-L-336px as the vision-language connector. Our modifications involved adding academic-task-oriented VQA data with response formatting prompts to create stronger baselines.\n\nThe specific techniques used include:\n\n* Pretraining on 129M image-text pairs using Qformer\n* Finetuning the instruction-aware Qformer model for visual instruction tuning\n* Utilizing a single linear layer to project visual features to language space, as in LLaVA\n* Optimizing the entire large language model (LLM) for visual instruction tuning\n\nThe chosen experimental setup involved:\n\n* Using 13B checkpoint with merely 1.2M publicly available data\n* Training on a single 8-A100 node, finishing full training in approximately 1 day\n\nOur research objectives align with testing hypotheses related to the design choices of LMMs, specifically exploring the performance of CLIP-ViT-L-336px with an MLP projection and adding academic-task-oriented VQA data. By comparing our results to previous studies, such as InstructBLIP and LLaVA, we aim to contribute to the understanding of how these models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, like real-life visual instruction-following tasks and academic benchmarks.\n\nFurthermore, by exploring modifications to LLaVA and establishing stronger baselines, we aimed to provide insights into scaling up LMMs to higher resolution inputs, examining compositional capabilities, and investigating model hallucination.",
    "results": "Hello! How can I assist you with your research today?\n\nYou've provided a results section from a paper on large multimodal models (LMMs) in visual instruction tuning. The key findings include:\n\n* The proposed LLaVA-1.5 baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks.\n* The model requires only 1.2M publicly available data and can be trained within a day on an 8-A100 node.\n* The authors explore open problems in LMMs, such as scaling to higher resolution inputs, compositional capabilities, and model hallucination.\n\nThese results contribute to addressing the research question by providing a simple, effective, and data-efficient baseline for large multimodal models. The findings also shed light on the design choices of LMMs under the LLaVA framework and offer a reference for future research in open-source LMM."
