    "research": "Based on the passage provided, I have identified the main research question as follows:\n\nQ1: Can we develop a suite of large language models (LLMs) that surpass previous open-weight models in performance across various benchmarks, while also addressing specific challenges such as long-context, multilingual, coding, mathematics capabilities and safety and responsibility?\n\nQ2: How can we make LLMs more accessible to researchers and developers by releasing their weights openly and providing supplementary resources for fine-tuning and deployment?\n\nContribution: This report introduces the Qwen2 series, a comprehensive suite of foundational and instruction-tuned language models that demonstrate competitive performance against proprietary models across various benchmarks in language understanding, generation, multilingual capabilities, coding, mathematics, and reasoning. The authors have made significant improvements to the model's performance by pre-training it on a large-scale dataset and fine-tuning it using supervised learning methods.\n\nThe passage highlights several key aspects of the Qwen2 series, including:\n\n* The development of four dense models with varying parameter counts (0.5B, 1.5B, 7B, and 72B) and a Mixture-of-Experts model\n* The pre-training of all models on a high-quality, large-scale dataset covering a wide range of domains and languages\n* The use of supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization (DPO) to align the models with human preferences\n* The release of the Qwen2 model weights openly to facilitate community innovation and accessibility\n\nOverall, this report aims to contribute to the advancement of AI technologies and their positive impact on society by providing a versatile suite of LLMs that can be used for various applications and research projects.",
