The authors integrate a state-space language model, Mamba, into a vision backbone, VMamba, which utilizes Visual State-Space (VSS) blocks and the 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) module. \n\nKey Methodological Approach: \n- **VMamba Architecture**: The authors develop a family of VMamba architectures based on VSS blocks and accelerate them through architectural and implementation enhancements.\n- **Selective Scan Mechanism**: To address the limitation of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, the authors employ a selective scan mechanism inspired by Gu et al.'s work, which integrates an input-dependent selection mechanism to gather contextual information from various sources and perspectives.\n\nData, Techniques, Models, or Tools:\n- **SSM Formulation**: The paper formulates SSMs as linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and discretizes them for integration into deep models.\n- **Selective Scan Discretization**: The authors use a discrete-time formulation of the Selective Scan mechanism to facilitate efficient computation of hidden states with linear complexity.\n\nHypotheses Tested:\n- **Computational Efficiency**: The paper aims to accelerate the performance of VMamba architectures compared to existing benchmark models in terms of input scaling efficiency.\n- **Contextual Information Capture**: The selective scan mechanism is designed to gather contextual information from various sources and perspectives, addressing the limitation of LTI systems.\n\nExperimental Setup:\n- **Visual Perception Tasks**: Extensive experiments are performed across diverse visual perception tasks to evaluate VMamba's performance and demonstrate its advantages in input scaling efficiency.\n\nComputational Methods:\n- **Associative Scan Algorithms**: The authors employ associative scan algorithms with linear complexity to efficiently compute the response y b using the recurrence relation derived from the selective scan mechanism.\n- **Zero-Order Hold (ZOH) Method**: The paper references the ZOH method as an approximation for the discretization of SSMs.\n\nAlignment with Research Objectives:\nThe methodology aligns with the research objectives by addressing the limitations of LTI systems and developing efficient computational methods to gather contextual information.
