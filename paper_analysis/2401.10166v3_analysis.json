    "method": "Methodology: Designing computationally efficient network architectures persists as an ongoing necessity in computer vision. In this paper, the authors employ a novel approach by transplanting Mamba, a state-space language model, into VMamba, a vision backbone that operates in linear time complexity. The core architecture of VMamba relies on Visual State-Space (VSS) blocks with the 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) module.\n\nKey Methodological Approach:\nThe authors utilize the Visual State-Space framework to develop a family of VMamba architectures, which enables efficient processing of visual perception tasks. To overcome the limitations of traditional LTI SSMs in capturing contextual information, they employ a selective scan mechanism, which allows for dynamic weighting parameters and linear complexity computation.\n\nData/Techniques/Models:\n1. **Visual State-Space (VSS) blocks**: The authors use VSS blocks as the core component of VMamba, facilitating efficient processing of visual perception tasks.\n2. **2D Selective Scan (SS2D) module**: This module enables the selective scan mechanism, which captures contextual information from various sources and perspectives.\n3. **Selective State-Space (SSM)**: The authors develop a novel parameterization method for SSMs that integrates an input-dependent selection mechanism, addressing the challenge of dynamic weighting parameters in LTI SSMs.\n4. **Associate Scan Algorithms**: These algorithms are used to efficiently compute hidden states and responses using linear complexity.\n\nHypotheses Tested:\nThe authors do not explicitly state specific hypotheses tested in this paper; however, their approach can be seen as testing the hypothesis that a state-space language model (Mamba) can be successfully integrated into a vision backbone (VMamba), improving its performance across diverse visual perception tasks.\n\nExperimental Setup:\nNo explicit experimental setup is described in the methodology section. However, it is mentioned that extensive experiments showcase VMABA's promising performance across various visual perception tasks.\n\nComputational Methods:\nThe authors employ linear complexity computational methods using associative scan algorithms to efficiently compute hidden states and responses in the selective SSM framework.",
