    "method": "Methodology: Large language models (LLMs) encode parametric knowledge about world facts and have shown remarkable performance in knowledge-driven NLP tasks, but their reliance on parametric knowledge may cause them to overlook contextual cues. To address this limitation, the authors propose using carefully designed prompting strategies to improve LLMs' contextual faithfulness in two aspects: knowledge conflict and prediction with abstention.\n\nThe authors employ a combination of data, techniques, models, and tools to achieve this goal. They utilize three datasets for machine reading comprehension (MRC) and relation extraction (RE) tasks, and experiment with different prompting templates, including attributed prompt (ATTR), instruction-based prompt (INSTR), opinion-based prompt (OPIN), and the combination of OPIN and INSTR.\n\nThe authors also use two large language models: GPT-3.5-175B and LLama-2-7B-chat. They compare the performance of these models on a range of tasks, including MRC, RE, and knowledge conflict settings, with varying levels of input prompts (e.g., ATTR, INSTR, OPIN, OPIN + INSTR) and output formats.\n\nIn terms of specific hypotheses tested, the authors aim to:\n\n1. Assess whether LLMs can accurately detect context-specific relationships between entities.\n2. Evaluate the impact of different prompting strategies on improving LLMs' contextual faithfulness in knowledge conflict situations.\n3. Compare the performance of different models (GPT-3.5-175B and LLama-2-7B-chat) on knowledge conflict tasks.\n\nExperimental setup: The authors conduct experiments using a combination of online data and demonstration-based settings. They use three datasets for MRC and RE tasks, and evaluate their models' performance on these tasks using various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).\n\nComputational methods: The authors employ a range of computational methods, including:\n\n1. Prompt engineering: designing new prompting templates to improve LLMs' contextual faithfulness.\n2. Data augmentation: creating additional training data to enhance model performance on knowledge conflict tasks.\n3. Knowledge-based prompting: using opinion-based prompts and counterfactual demonstrations to encourage LLMs to reason more critically about context-specific relationships.\n\nOverall, the authors propose a nuanced approach to improving large language models' contextual faithfulness in knowledge-driven NLP tasks, highlighting the importance of carefully designed prompting strategies and data augmentation techniques.",
    "results": "Results: The main findings of this study show that large language models (LLMs) can be improved to exhibit greater contextual faithfulness in two key aspects: knowledge conflict and prediction with abstention. The authors demonstrate that carefully designed prompting strategies, specifically opinion-based prompts and counterfactual demonstrations, significantly enhance LLMs' ability to accurately predict outcomes in context-sensitive NLP tasks.\n\nSpecifically, the experiments conducted on three datasets of machine reading comprehension and relation extraction reveal significant improvements in faithfulness to contexts, with these methods outperforming existing approaches. The authors also propose that their proposed methods do not require additional training, making them a practical solution for enhancing LLMs' contextual understanding."
