    "research": "Q1: What are the limitations of current Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) and how do they compare to proprietary models in terms of training and optimization?\n\nQ2: How can LVLMs be improved to support fine-grained visual understanding, such as object grounding and text reading, while still leveraging the benefits of their large language model baseline?\n\nContribution: In this work, we introduce the Qwen-VL series, a set of large-scale vision-language models designed to overcome the limitations of current LVLMs by introducing a new visual receptor, a 3-stage training pipeline, and fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.",
    "method": "Methodology: The authors employed a multi-faceted approach to develop the Qwen-VL series of vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrates visual perception with natural language understanding. The methodology consists of four key components:\n\n1. **Visual Receptor**: A meticulously designed visual receptor is integrated into the Qwen-LM foundation to endow it with visual capacity, enabling the model to perceive and process visual information.\n2. **Input-Output Interface**: An optimized input-output interface is created to facilitate seamless communication between the visual receptor and the language processing module, ensuring efficient data flow and accurate representation of visual inputs.\n3. **3-stage Training Pipeline**: A three-stage training pipeline is implemented to fine-tune the Qwen-LM on a multilingual multimodal cleaned corpus, allowing the model to learn from both textual and visual inputs simultaneously.\n4. **Multilingual Multimodal Cleaned Corpus**: A large-scale, carefully curated dataset of image-caption-box tuples is utilized for training, enabling the Qwen-VL models to develop grounding and text-reading abilities.\n\nThe authors also employed various techniques, such as:\n\n* **Alignment of Image-Caption-Box Tuples**: The alignment of image-caption-box tuples allows the Qwen-VL models to develop a more nuanced understanding of visual information, enabling them to recognize objects, locations, and other relevant features within images.\n* **Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning**: The authors test their models' performance on both zero-shot and few-shot learning benchmarks, evaluating their ability to generalize across a wide range of tasks and domains.\n\nThe research objectives are aligned with the methodology through:\n\n* Developing models that can effectively perceive and understand both texts and images.\n* Improving the visual capacity of generalist models, enabling them to perform well on visual-centric benchmarks such as image captioning and question answering.\n* Demonstrating the superiority of Qwen-VL models over existing vision-language chatbots in real-world dialog benchmarks.\n\nOverall, the methodology employed by the authors enables the creation of highly effective vision-language models that can tackle a wide range of applications and tasks.",
    "results": "Results: The authors present key findings from the introduction of the Qwen-VL series, a set of large-scale vision-language models (LVLMs) designed to perceive and understand both texts and images.\n\n* The Qwen-LM is endowed with visual capacity through the design of a visual receptor, input-output interface, 3-stage training pipeline, and multilingual multimodal cleaned corpus, leading to superior performance on visual-centric benchmarks such as image captioning, question answering, and visual grounding.\n* The resulting models, including QwenVL and Qwen-VL-Chat, set new records for generalist models under similar model scales, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks and settings.\n* On real-world dialog benchmarks, the instruction-tuned Qwen-VL-Chat outperforms existing vision-language chatbots, showcasing its superiority in multilingual conversations, multi-image interleaved conversations, and fine-grained recognition.\n\nThese results contribute to advancing the field by introducing a new family of large-scale multilingual LVLMs that facilitate multimodal research. The Qwen-VL series sets a new standard for generalist models in visual-centric benchmarks, while also demonstrating its capabilities in real-world dialog scenarios."
