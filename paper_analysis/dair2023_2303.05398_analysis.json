    "method": "Methodology: MathPrompter employs a Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting technique to generate multiple Algebraic expressions or Python functions to solve math problems in different ways, aiming to increase confidence levels in output results. This approach leverages insights from human problem-solving strategies, such as compliance with known results, multi-verification, cross-checking, and computational verification, to evaluate the effectiveness of MathPrompter on arithmetic reasoning tasks. The technique is specifically designed to address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving math problems by providing a clear method for generating accurate solutions and assessing confidence levels.",
    "results": "Results: \n\nThe key findings reported by the authors indicate that Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with arithmetic reasoning tasks, often providing incorrect answers due to the single correct solution characteristic of math problems. To address this limitation, they propose 'MathPrompter', a technique using Zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting that generates multiple Algebraic expressions or Python functions to solve a problem, thereby increasing confidence in output results.\n\nQuantitatively, MathPrompter improves over state-of-the-art on the MultiArith dataset by 13.8 percentage points (78.7% \u2192 92.5%) when using a 175B parameter GPT-based LLM, outperforming both SOTA Few-shot-CoT models and larger Zero-shot-CoT models.\n\nThe results demonstrate that MathPrompter can effectively improve the performance of LLMs on arithmetic reasoning problems while addressing the trust deficit in these models by providing increased reliance in predictions."
