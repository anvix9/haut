    "method": "Methodology: We utilized a novel approach that integrates three key elements to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and enabling high-quality real-time (\u2265 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. Specifically, we employed Radiance Field methods in conjunction with:\n\n1. **3D Gaussians**: Representing the scene using 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance/fields for scene optimization, while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space.\n2. **Interleaved Optimization/Density Control**: Performing concurrent optimization and density control of the 3D Gaussians, focusing on anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene.\n3. **Visibility-Aware Rendering Algorithm**: Developing a fast rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and accelerates training and real-time rendering.\n\nThese techniques enabled us to overcome existing limitations in achieving real-time display rates for unbounded and complete scenes at 1080p resolution, ultimately demonstrating state-of-the-art visual quality on established datasets.",

The use of 3D Gaussians as a primitive preserves desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for optimization, allowing fast splat-based rasterization.\n2. Interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians enables accurate representation of the scene with anisotropic covariance.\n3.
