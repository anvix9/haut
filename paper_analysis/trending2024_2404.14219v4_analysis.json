    "research": "Q1: Why is it possible to train a language model small enough to fit on a phone, yet rival the capabilities of large models like ChatGPT?\n\nContribution: We introduce phi-3-mini , a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on a scaled-up version of publicly available web data and synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to larger models despite its compact size, thus demonstrating the potential of carefully curated training data in reducing model size without sacrificing capability.",
    "method": "Methodology:.... We employ a combination of pre-training, fine-tuning, and optimization techniques to develop the Phi-3.5-Vision multimodal model. Specifically:\n\n*   **Pre-training**: The Phi-3.5-Vision model is pre-trained on a diverse dataset consisting of:\n    *   Interleaved image-text documents (e.g., [LST + 24])\n    *   Image-text pairs from FLD-5B [XWX + 24]\n    *   Synthetic data derived from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of PDF files\n    *   Datasets for chart/table comprehension and text-only data\n*   **Pre-training objective**: The model is trained to predict the next token in a sequence, specifically on text tokens.\n*   **Post-training stages**:\n    *   **Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**: The model is fine-tuned on a text SFT dataset, public multimodal instruct tuning datasets, and large-scale multimodal instruct tuning datasets.\n    *   **Direct preference optimization (DPO)**: The model is optimized using a text DPO dataset and a smaller-scale multimodal DPO dataset.\n\nThese pre-training and post-training stages are designed to enhance the model's ability to process and reason with both visual and textual inputs.",
    "results": "Results: \n\nThe main findings reported by the authors are:\n\n* The introduction of phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model that achieves competitive performance on various benchmarks (69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench) with a small deployment size.\n* Parameter-scaling results show improved performance across models in the phi-3 series, including phi-3-small, phi-3-medium, phi-3-MoE, and phi-3-Vision, which outperform phi-3-mini on multiple benchmarks (75% to 78% on MMLU).\n* The phi-3.5-MoE model demonstrates superior performance in language reasoning, math, and code tasks, rivaling popular models like Gemini-1.5-Flash and GPT-4o-mini.\n* The phi-3.5-Vision model excels in reasoning tasks, handling both single-image and text prompts, as well as multi-image and text prompts.\n\nThese results contribute to addressing the research question by showcasing the effectiveness of scaling up language models, introducing novel methodologies (such as MoE), and advancing the field through the introduction of more specialized models (phi-3.5-Vision)."
