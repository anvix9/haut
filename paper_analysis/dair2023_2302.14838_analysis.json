    "research": "Research Problem: Q1: Can evolutionary search methods improve the performance of large language models (LMs) in generating novel and effective neural architectures through iterative in-context prompting and prompt-tuning?\n\nContribution: Given that LMs have shown impressive performance on various natural language processing tasks, yet struggle with creating novel solutions to complex problems, we propose a method called EVOPROMPTING, which uses evolutionary search to create and curate data to improve LM in-context prompting examples.",
    "method": "Methodology: The authors employ an evolutionary approach, utilizing language models as general adaptive mutation and crossover operators within a neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm. Specifically, they use a method called EVOPROMPTING, which combines evolutionary prompt engineering with soft prompt tuning.\n\nGiven this approach, the key components of their methodology include:\n\n- **Dataset**: The authors use datasets for specific machine learning tasks, such as MNIST-1D and CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark. These datasets serve as the input-output pairs (x, y) that are used to train models.\n- **Evaluation function**: EVAL T(c, D) is a crucial component of their method, which trains a model architecture given by code c on dataset D and outputs a real-valued fitness score s. This score can be based on various factors such as accuracy or other model characteristics.\n- **Language/model parameterization**: The probability distribution \u03c0 \u03b8 over vocabulary V is modeled using a language/code model, with parameters \u03b8 that define the sampling mechanism for code segments c \u2208 V\u2217.\n- **Evolutionary prompt engineering and soft prompt tuning (EVOPROMPTING)**: This method combines evolutionary techniques with learning-based fine-tuning of prompts. It helps in optimizing the design of neural network architectures by iteratively refining the model through adaptation to diverse input data.\n- **Computational methods**: The authors' approach relies on using language models for code generation, sampling, and optimization. Their implementation involves leveraging various tools or platforms that are optimized for handling such complex computational tasks.\n\nOverall, the methodology employed here aligns with the research objectives of identifying high-performing neural network architectures through an adaptive evolutionary process.",
