    "research": "Q1: How do existing large language models (LLMs) achieve high-throughput serving with efficient memory management, and what are the limitations of current approaches?\n\nQ2: Can LLM serving systems efficiently manage the KV cache memory to reduce internal fragmentation and external fragmentation, leading to improved serving performance?\n\nA1: Existing LLM serving systems struggle to manage the KV cache memory efficiently due to their reliance on contiguous memory allocation for tensors, resulting in significant internal and external memory fragmentation.\n\nA2: No.",
    "method": "Methodology: The authors propose a novel attention algorithm, PagedAttention, and an LLM serving engine, vLLM, to address the challenges of large-scale LLMs in high-throughput serving. To achieve this, they employ a centralized scheduler to coordinate distributed GPU workers and a KV cache manager that effectively manages the physical KV cache memory on the GPU workers through the instructions sent by the centralized scheduler.\n\nThe authors use OPT [62] models with 13B, 66B, and 175B parameters and LLaMA [52] with 13B parameters for their evaluation. They synthesize workloads based on ShareGPT [51] and Alpaca [50] datasets, which contain input and output texts of real LLM services.\n\nThe authors implement two baseline systems: FasterTransformer and Orca. They also develop custom versions of these baselines to compare with the proposed vLLM system. The key metrics evaluated are serving throughput and normalized latency.\n\nThe PagedAttention algorithm is designed to facilitate effective memory management for various decoding methods, including parallel generation and beam search. The KV cache manager manages the physical KV cache memory on the GPU workers through the instructions sent by the centralized scheduler, enabling efficient sharing of KV cache within and across requests.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of vLLM, the authors use a variety of metrics, including serving throughput and normalized latency. They also provide detailed analysis of the memory savings achieved by sharing KV cache in different scenarios, which shows that vLLM can achieve significant memory saving compared to existing systems.\n\nOverall, the proposed vLLM system is designed to address the challenges of large-scale LLMs in high-throughput serving, and its novel attention algorithm and LLM serving engine enable efficient memory management and improved performance.",
    "results": "Results:...\n\nThe key findings of this paper include:\n\n* The proposed PagedAttention algorithm enables efficient management of the key-value (KV) cache memory for large language models (LLMs), achieving near-zero waste and flexible sharing within and across requests.\n* vLLM, a high-throughput LLM serving system, achieves 2-4 \u00d7 throughput improvements compared to state-of-the-art systems like FasterTransformer and Orca, with the most pronounced gains observed in longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms.\n* The optimal block size for vLLM is found to be 16, which efficiently utilizes GPU parallelism while minimizing internal fragmentation.\n* The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of applying virtual memory and paging techniques to other GPU workloads, but cautions that these methods may not be suitable for every workload, particularly those with static tensor shapes or compute-bound performance.\n\nThese results contribute to addressing the research question by providing a novel approach to managing LLM serving systems, which can lead to significant improvements in throughput while maintaining low latency. The findings also demonstrate the adaptability of virtual memory and paging techniques to other GPU workloads, opening up new possibilities for optimizing GPU performance in various applications."
