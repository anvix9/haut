    "research": "Q1: What is the proposed approach to improve zero-shot performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in cross-task and cross-model scenarios, addressing the limitations of existing fine-tuning and prompt engineering methods?\n\nContribution: UPRISE ( U niversal P rompt R etrieval for I mproving ZeroS hot E valuation), a lightweight and versatile approach that tunes a prompt retriever to automatically retrieve prompts from a pre-constructed pool given a zero-shot task input, enabling cross-task generalization and adaptation to different LLMs of varying scales.",
    "method": "Methodology: UPRISE employs a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) as lightweight retrievers for automatically retrieving prompts for zero-shot tasks. The method involves:\n\n1.  **Data Construction**: Instruction templates from FLAN are used to convert task datasets into natural language instructions, ensuring the text format is similar to that of the pre-training corpus.\n2.  **Prompt Pool**: A prompt pool is created by concatenating training demonstrations of remaining task clusters, inspired by in-context learning. This approach enables the retriever to leverage similarities between question types, topics, or reasoning chains across different tasks.\n3.  **Fine-tuning**: The prompt encoder is fine-tuned using a frozen LLM (GPT-Neo-2.7B) on diverse tasks, allowing it to adapt to new task inputs and retrieve relevant prompts.\n4.  **Inference Pipeline**: The trained retriever uses maximum inner-product search over the prompt pool to retrieve K most similar prompts for unseen task types, sorted by their inner product in descending order.\n\nThe UPRISE method addresses the research question by:\n\n1.  Demonstrating universality across crosstask and cross-model scenarios, utilizing a small frozen LLM for tuning and testing on different LLMs of larger scales.\n2.  Mitigating the hallucination problem with ChatGPT, showcasing its potential to improve even the strongest LLMs.\n\nOverall, the UPRISE approach integrates the strengths of large language models as lightweight retrievers for prompt retrieval, enabling efficient inference and improved performance in zero-shot tasks.",
    "results": "Results: The key findings reported by the authors are that their proposed model, UPRISE (Universal Prompt Retrieval for Improving Zero-shot Evaluation), demonstrates universality in a crosstask and cross-model scenario. They show that their lightweight and versatile retriever automatically retrieves prompts for a given zero-shot task input, improves performance on various natural language understanding tasks, and mitigates the hallucination problem with ChatGPT. The results also indicate that UPRISE performs better than vanilla zero-shot prompting and few-shot prompting on some tasks.\n\nQuantitative metrics suggest that UPRISE outperforms 0-SHOT across most task types, especially in tasks like Reading Comprehension and Closed-book QA. However, it shows limited impact on language modeling tasks such as Coreference Resolution and Commonsense Reasoning. The results further reveal that the model's universality is generalizable to unseen task types and different LLMs of varying scales.\n\nOverall, these findings contribute to addressing the research question by demonstrating a more efficient approach for improving zero-shot performance in large language models. The study advances the field by providing insights into the potential of universal prompt retrieval for improving the performance of large language models across diverse tasks and settings."
