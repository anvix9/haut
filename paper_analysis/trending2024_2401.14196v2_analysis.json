    "research": "Q1: Can large open-source code models be developed that can effectively perform code infilling and generation comparable to or surpassing closed-source models like Codex and GPT-3.5? \n\nContribution: The authors introduce the DeepSeek-Coder series, a range of open-source code models (DeepSeek-Coder-Base and DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct) with sizes from 1.3B to 33B, trained from scratch on 2 trillion tokens sourced from 87 programming languages.",
    "method": "Methodology: The key methodological approach used by the authors is centered around developing a series of open-source code models called DeepSeek-Coder, which employ a range of techniques to enhance code generation and infilling capabilities.\n\nData: The authors utilize a high-quality project-level code corpus for pre-training their models and train them from scratch on 2 trillion tokens. They also use a variety of benchmarks to evaluate the performance of their models.\n\nTechniques: The fill-in-the-blank task with a 16K window, combined with pre-training on a high-quality code corpus, is used to enhance code generation and infilling capabilities. Additionally, they employ Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), Grouped-Query-Attention (GQA), and FlashAttention v2 to improve training and inference efficiency.\n\nModels: The authors develop a range of models with varying parameters (1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B) that are built upon the same framework as the DeepSeek Large Language Model (LLM). Each model is a decoder-only Transformer incorporating RoPE and GQA, with the 33B model further integrating FlashAttention v2 to expedite computation.\n\nTools: While not explicitly stated, the authors likely utilize frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow for building and training their models. The use of specialized libraries like DeepSeek-AI's LLM framework and the FlashAttention v2 implementation suggest a tailored approach to specific techniques.\n\nExperimental setups: The performance of each model is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models. \n\nHypotheses tested: It appears that the authors aimed to test whether an open-source, pre-trained model could outperform existing closed-source models like Codex and GPT-3.5 on code generation and infilling tasks.\n\nAlignment with research objectives: The methodological approach closely aligns with the research objective of addressing the limitations of closed-source code intelligence by introducing an open-source alternative that achieves state-of-the-art performance and allows for unrestricted commercial use.",
    "results": "Results: The main findings reported by the authors include:\n\n- DeepSeek-Coder series achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source code models across multiple benchmarks.\n- The models surpass existing closed-source models such as Codex and GPT-3.5.\n- The advanced model, DeepSeek-CoderBase 33B, outperforms various standard tests.\n- Fine-tuning the models with high-quality instructional data leads to exceptional proficiency in code generation and understanding.\n- Additional pretraining based on a diverse dataset results in an improved code model, DeepSeek-Coder-v1.5, with enhanced natural language comprehension.\n\nThese findings contribute to addressing the research question by introducing a range of open-source code models (DeepSeek-Coder) that overcome the limitations of closed-source models. The achievements demonstrate the potential of Large Language Models for coding tasks and lay the groundwork for further development and expansion into more powerful code-focused LLMs."
