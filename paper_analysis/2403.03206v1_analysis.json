    "results": "Results: \nThe authors report several key findings from their study on rectified flow models for text-to-image synthesis. They demonstrate superior performance of a biasing technique towards perceptually relevant scales compared to established diffusion formulations, outperforming state-of-the-art models. Additionally, they present a novel transformer-based architecture that uses separate weights for the two modalities, which improves text comprehension, typography, and human preference ratings. Their scalability analysis up to 8B parameters shows no signs of saturation, suggesting potential for future performance improvements."
