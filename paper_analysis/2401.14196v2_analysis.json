    "method": "Methodology: ...The key methodological approach used by the authors revolves around the development and training of open-source code models, specifically the DeepSeek-Coder series. The primary data employed is a high-quality project-level code corpus, from which the models are pre-trained using a fill-in-the-blank task with a 16K window.\n\nTo address the research question, the authors utilized a combination of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to generate and complete code snippets. The main hypotheses tested relate to the performance of DeepSeek-Coder models in comparison to existing closed-source models. \n\nExperimental setups involve training the models from scratch on 2 trillion tokens and evaluating their performance across multiple benchmarks, such as state-of-the-art open-source code models and commercially available models like Codex and GPT-3.5.\n\nThe computational methods employed include:\n\n1. Pre-training on a high-quality project-level code corpus\n2. Utilizing fill-in-the-blank tasks to enhance code generation and infilling\n\nThese approaches align with the research objectives by demonstrating the effectiveness of open-source, pre-trained code models for software development tasks.",
    "results": "Results:\n\nThe authors report several key findings that demonstrate the effectiveness of their DeepSeek-Coder series of open-source code models. These include:\n\n* State-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, surpassing existing closed-source models such as Codex and GPT-3.5.\n* Exceptional proficiency in code generation and understanding, with the top-performing model (DeepSeek-CoderBase 33B) outperforming OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo in coding-related tasks.\n* Improved natural language comprehension through additional pretraining based on a diverse dataset, resulting in a new and improved code model (DeepSeek-Coder-v1.5).\n* Demonstrated performance on par with or surpassing existing open-source code models, even among those with smaller parameter sizes (e.g., DeepSeek-Coder-Base 6.7B and CodeLlama).\n\nThese results contribute to addressing the research question by providing a scalable and high-quality alternative to closed-source code models, while also advancing the field through their innovative pre-training objectives and evaluation metrics."
