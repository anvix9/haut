    "research": "Q1: What are the primary capabilities of the proposed Large Language Model (LLM) series QWEN?\n\nQ2: How do the LLMs outperform existing models on benchmark tasks, specifically in coding and mathematics?\n\nQ3: What techniques are used for alignment and fine-tuning of the chat models in the QWEN series?\n\nContribution: The QWEN series presents a comprehensive language model series that encompasses distinct models with varying parameter counts, including base pretrained language models, chat models finetuned with human alignment techniques, and specialized models in coding and math.",
    "method": "Methodology: The authors employed a range of methodologies to develop and train their large language model, QWEN. Specifically:\n\n* **Training architecture:** They utilized a modified version of the Transformer architecture, building upon recent open-source approaches such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a).\n* **Model sizes and hyperparameters:** The authors offered three model variants with different parameter counts: 1.8B, 7B, and 14B parameters, each with varying hidden sizes, attention heads, layers, learning rates, batch sizes, and training tokens.\n* **Embedding and output projection:** They opted for an untied embedding approach to achieve better performance at the cost of increased memory costs.\n* **Positional embedding:** The authors chose RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) as their preferred option for incorporating positional information into the model, citing its success in contemporary large language models like PaLM and LLaMA.\n* **Bias removal and enhancement:** They removed biases from most layers but added them to the QKV layer to enhance extrapolation ability, following recent research on this topic (Su, 2023b).\n* **Normalization techniques:** The authors replaced traditional layer normalization with RMSNorm (Jiang et al., 2023) for improved training stability and efficiency.\n* **Activation function:** They selected SwiGLU as their activation function, combining elements of Swish and Gated Linear Unit to achieve better performance than baseline options.\n\nThe models were trained using various computational methods, including the LLaMA approach (Touvron et al., 2023a), which has been widely regarded as a top open-source LLM. The authors' modifications aim to prioritize model performance while reducing memory costs.",
    "results": "Results: The authors report several key findings on the performance of their large language model, QWEN:\n\n* The base language models outperform open-source models across various downstream tasks.\n* Chat models, especially those fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), demonstrate highly competitive performance and advanced tool-use capabilities.\n* Coding-specialized models (CODE-QWEN, CODE-QWEN-CHAT) show significantly improved performance compared to open-source models, while slightly lagging behind proprietary models.\n* Mathematics-focused models (MATH-QWEN-CHAT) also exhibit strong performance, with results that are comparable to or even surpassing some proprietary models.\n\nThese findings demonstrate the capabilities of QWEN in handling a range of tasks and domains, from general language understanding to specialized areas like coding and mathematics. The authors' work contributes to advancing the field by providing a comprehensive language model series (QWEN) that is accessible and open for further development and application."
