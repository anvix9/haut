    "method": "Methodology:.....:\n\nThe authors employed a mixed-methods approach to investigate the creativity of human-generated ideas compared to those generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots. The primary data collection involved two main components: \n\n1. Human participants: Sixty-four individuals completed an Alternative Use Test, writing down as many ideas as possible for five common objects. This test assessed their creative potential and reliability.\n\n2. GAI chatbots: Six GAI chatbots (alpa.ai, Copy.ai, ChatGPT 3 and 4, Studio.ai, YouChat) generated responses to the same prompts (\"What can you do with [prompt]?\"), and these were compared to human-generated ideas. The authors ensured that all chatbot responses went through quality control checks to eliminate irrelevant answers.\n\nData collection was carried out in early February 2023. Human raters rated the responses from both human participants and GAI chatbots, using a CAT (Creative Assessment Test) method to score originality on a scale of 1-5. Additionally, trained large language models evaluated the originality scores for all generated answers.\n\nComputational methods were used primarily in analyzing the chatbot data by identifying the reliability of results through the AI model.",
    "results": "Results: The study compared the creativity of human-generated ideas with those generated by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots, including ChatGPT, Copy.ai, Studio.ai, YouChat, and two versions of ChatGPT. Key findings include:\n\n1. **No qualitative difference in creativity**: Humans and GAI chatbots showed no significant differences in the quality or quantity of generated ideas.\n2. **9.4% human outperforming GAI-4**: Humans surpassed the most creative GAI (ChatGPT-4) in a small number of cases, suggesting that humans can be more creative than current GAI systems.\n3. **GAI's potential value as assistants**: The study highlights GAI chatbots' ability to generate ideas on a level comparable to human creativity, especially for everyday tasks.\n4. **Limitations and potential misuses**: Researchers caution against overestimating GAI's capabilities and emphasize the need to address ethical concerns regarding misuse or harm.\n\nThe results suggest that GAI chatbots are valuable assistants in generating ideas, but not necessarily replacing human creative abilities. The study contributes to understanding the potential benefits and limitations of AI-assisted creativity, emphasizing the importance of human creative roles in an increasingly automated world."
