    "research": "Q1: How can a large-scale vision-language foundation model (InternVL) be effectively aligned with a large language model (LLM) to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various visual and vision-language tasks?\n\nContribution: The proposed InternVL model demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of generic visuallinguistic tasks, including visual perception tasks, visionlanguage tasks, and multi-modal dialogue, by aligning the large-scale vision encoder with LLMs for the first time.",
    "method": "Methodology: The authors' methodological approach is primarily based on designing and training a large-scale vision-language foundation model, InternVL. This involves:\n\n* Utilizing web-scale image-text data from various sources, which amounts to approximately 500 GB in size.\n* Employing the pre-training objective for the InternVL model being \"text-conditional\" using the CLIP model's approach. The CLIP model was trained on the same web-scale dataset.\n\nKey components of the methodology:\n\n* Large-scale training objectives with over 6 billion parameters, which is significantly larger than current vision foundation models like ViT-22B.\n* Pre-training in a self-supervised manner utilizing only text information and leveraging it to gain capabilities similar to large language models (LLMs).",
    "results": "Results: \nThe authors present InternVL, a large-scale vision-language foundation model (InternViT-6B) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on 32 generic visual-linguistic benchmarks. Key findings include:\n\n* Scalability: InternViT-6B has 6 billion parameters and outperforms the ViT-22B in various tasks.\n* Generalizability: The model demonstrates proficiency in a wide range of tasks, including image/video classification, image/video-text retrieval, image captioning, visual question answering, and multi-modal dialogue.\n* Multi-modality: InternVL integrates well with LLMs, enabling the creation of multi-modal dialogue systems.\n\nThese results contribute to addressing the research question by bridging the gap between vision foundation models and large language models. The findings advance the field by providing a scalable and generalizable model for visual-linguistic tasks, which can be used to develop more robust and versatile multimodal AGI systems."
