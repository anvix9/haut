    "method": "Methodology: The methodology employed by the authors in this work is centered around developing a large-scale vision-language foundation model called InternVL, which aims to bridge the gap between vision and language capabilities in multimodal AGI systems.\n\nThe key methodological approach used by the authors involves using web-scale image-text data from various sources to train and scale up the vision foundation model. This approach enables the creation of a powerful visual model that can be progressively aligned with large language models (LLMs). The InternVL model is designed to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 32 generic visual-linguistic benchmarks, including both visual perception tasks and vision-language tasks.\n\nSpecifically, the authors employed the following techniques:\n\n* Utilization of web-scale image-text data from various sources to train and fine-tune the vision foundation model.\n* Use of a large number of parameters (6 billion) for the InternVL model, which is comparable to some of the largest LLMs.\n* Progressive alignment of the vision foundation model with LLMs to create a hybrid model that combines both visual and language capabilities.\n\nIn terms of data, the authors used web-scale image-text data from various sources, including but not limited to:\n\n* Web images\n* Text data from various sources (e.g. books, articles, etc.)\n* Large datasets for vision-language tasks such as zero-shot image/video classification, zero-shot image/video-text retrieval\n\nThe model employed by the authors is based on a combination of computer vision and natural language processing techniques, with the use of architectures such as:\n\n* Vision foundation models\n* Large language models (LLMs)\n\nExperimental setup: The experimental setup for this work involves evaluating the performance of the InternVL model on various visual-linguistic benchmarks. The authors tested the model's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 32 generic visual-linguistic benchmarks, including both visual perception tasks and vision-language tasks.\n\nHypotheses tested: The authors aimed to test the hypothesis that a large-scale vision-language foundation model can be designed and trained using web-scale image-text data from various sources. They also aimed to demonstrate that such a model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various visual-linguistic benchmarks.\n\nComputational methods: The computational methods employed by the authors involve:\n\n* Training and fine-tuning the vision foundation model using web-scale image-text data.\n* Progressive alignment of the vision foundation model with LLMs.\n* Evaluation of the model's performance on various visual-linguistic benchmarks.",
