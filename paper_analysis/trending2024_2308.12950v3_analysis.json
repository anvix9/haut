    "method": "Methodology: The authors employed a combination of large-scale language modeling and multi-task learning to develop Code Llama, a family of large language models for code. The key methodological approach used by the authors is as follows:\n\n* **Large-scale training datasets**: The models were trained on sequences of 16k tokens, with up to 100k token inputs, sourced from a near-deduplicated dataset of publicly available code and supplemented with natural language datasets related to code.\n* **Language model architecture**: Code Llama was based on the Llama 2 model architecture, which uses a transformer encoder-decoder structure. The models were fine-tuned using this architecture with a large number of parameters (7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B) to improve performance.\n* **Multi-task learning**: The authors used multi-task learning to fine-tune the models on multiple tasks, including code completion and natural language understanding. This approach helped the model retain its natural language understanding skills.\n* **Byte pair encoding (BPE)**: The data was tokenized using BPE, a widely used method for subword-based word representation.\n* **Sampling from natural language datasets**: A small proportion of batches were sampled from a natural language dataset to help the model retain its natural language understanding skills.\n\nThe specific hypotheses tested and experimental setups can be summarized as follows:\n\n* **Hypothesis 1**: The use of large-scale training datasets will improve the performance of the models on code completion tasks.\n* **Experiment setup**: The authors trained multiple variants of Code Llama (7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B) on different-sized training datasets.\n* **Computational method**: The models were fine-tuned using a transformer encoder-decoder structure with a large number of parameters.\n\nOverall, the methodology employed by the authors involved leveraging large-scale language modeling and multi-task learning to develop Code Llama, which demonstrated state-of-the-art performance among open models on several code benchmarks.",
    "results": "Results:\nThe key findings of this paper are:\n\n- The Code Llama models, which include foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct), with varying sizes (7B, 13B, 34B, and 70B parameters) achieve state-of-the-art performance on code benchmarks.\n- The Code Llama models outperform other publicly available models on various benchmark scores, including up to 67% and 65% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively.\n- The models demonstrate the ability to support infilling based on surrounding content and leverage large contexts.\n- However, larger models with more parameters come at a cost in terms of performance on standard benchmarks left-to-right code generation.\n\nThese results contribute to addressing the research question by showcasing the capabilities and limitations of large language models for code-based applications. The advancements made by this paper will advance the field by providing a new benchmark for evaluating model performance, promoting further innovation in code understanding and generation, and demonstrating the potential for zero-shot instruction following ability in programming tasks."
