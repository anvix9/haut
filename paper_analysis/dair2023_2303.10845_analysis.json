By utilizing Random Routed Experts (RRE) and Expert Computation Storage Separation (ECSS), the training throughput is improved by 6.3x compared to the model of the same hyper-parameters but with dense Transformer architecture, demonstrating the potential for efficient scaling of large language models on limited compute budget and distributed across multiple accelerating devices.",
    "method": "Methodology: The authors employ a distributed training setup using a cluster of Ascend 910 AI processors and the MindSpore framework to train their trillion-parameter language model, PanGu\u03a3. To leverage heterogeneous computing, they utilize Expert Computation and Storage Separation (ECSS), which separates computation and storage for each expert (a sub-module of the dense Transformer model) to achieve efficient training throughput.\n\nSpecifically, they:\n\n1. **Use a scaled-up version of PanGu\u03b1**: The authors extend the dense Transformer model by incorporating Random Routed Experts (RRE) and train it on a massive 1.085T parameters dataset.\n2. **Employ distributed training with ECSS**: By separating computation and storage for each expert, they achieve a 6.3x increase in training throughput compared to traditional training methods.\n\nThe experimental setup involves training PanGu\u03a3 using the following configuration:\n- 40 layers (N+M)\n- 40 attention heads (N_h)\n- Hidden size: 5120\n- Feed-forward network size: 20480\n- 8 Random Routed Experts (RRE) layers\n- 640 experts per group\n- 40 groups\n\nThe authors' methodology aligns with their research objectives of developing a state-of-the-art language model for Chinese NLP tasks and demonstrating its performance in various applications, such as zero-shot learning, open-domain dialogue, question answering, machine translation, and code generation.",
