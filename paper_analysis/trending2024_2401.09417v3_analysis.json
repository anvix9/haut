Specifically, Vim is 2.8 \u00d7 faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images at the resolution of 1248 \u00d7 1248.\n\nQ3: Can the proposed Vision Mamba (Vim) model be used for unsupervised tasks such as mask image modeling pretraining, and has it been shown that it enables multimodal tasks such as CLIP-style pretraining?\n\nContribution: Like Transformers, Vim can be pretrained on large-scale unsupervised visual data for better visual representation. Thanks to the better efficiency of Mamba, the large-scale pretraining of Vim can be achieved with lower computational cost.\n\nQ4: What are the future directions for the proposed Vision Mamba (Vim) model, and what downstream tasks can it be used for?\n\nContribution: In future works, Vim with the bidirectional SSM modeling with position embeddings is suitable for unsupervised tasks such as mask image modeling pretraining and the similar architecture with Mamba enables multimodal tasks such as CLIP-style pretraining. Based on the pretrained Vim weights, exploring the usefulness of Vim for analyzing high-resolution medical images, remote sensing images, and long videos, which can be regarded as downstream tasks, is very straightforward.",
    "method": "Methodology: Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models.\n\nThe key methodological approach used by the authors involves:\n\n* Employing 16 \u00d7 16 kernel size projection layer to get a 1-D sequence of non-overlapping patch embeddings.\n* Stacking L Vim blocks, where each block processes input token sequences and utilizes bidirectional SSMs for compression and global context incorporation.\n* Ablating different strategies for the bidirectional design, including none, bidirectional layer, bidirectional SSM, and bidirectional SSM + Conv1d, to evaluate their effects on performance.\n* Experientimenting with various classification strategies, such as mean pool, max pool, head class token, double class token, and middle class token, to identify the most effective one.\n\nThe proposed Vim architecture utilizes the Mamba deep learning model's efficient hardware-aware designs and adapts it for vision tasks by incorporating position embeddings and bidirectional state space models. This approach allows for more efficient representation of visual data while leveraging the strengths of SSMs in modeling sequential dependencies.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of Vim, the authors use various benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks. The results show that Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while demonstrating significantly improved computation & memory efficiency.",
